4191___9am: Morning, folks. Is it coming home, or is it going on an all-expenses-paid trip to the antipodes? Today we'll get a bit closer to finding out. Six weeks after England kicked off their tournament at The Oval, things are about to get properly crunchy for the hosts. New England versus old masters Australia, in a titanic dust-up to take on India New Zealand in the final. England, who haven't won a knockout match since 1992 (and haven't beaten Australia at the World Cup in the intervening period, either), against Australia, who've won seven WC semi-finals out of seven (not to mention picked up the trophy five times). The first semi-final gave us a two-dayer for the ages, but what has Brum got in store for us? Fill up that mug of rosy lea and kick back with a read of our preview, because we're about to find out...

4191___"Is it sad that I have been refreshing this page whilst at work since about half 8 waiting for the hour and a half of live text build up to start? I am just too excited. I can't function." It's okay, Paddles, we're here now. No need to be functional, other than to occasionally press refresh

4191___9.05am: First things first, here's our Birmingham local guide, George Dobell, with an update from the ground: "Morning from Edgbaston. Lovely morning it is, too. Much brighter than expected. Forecast a bit better, too." The jewel of the midlands sparkling - who would ever suggest otherwise?

4191___"According to the list of world cup finals on Wikipedia, India have already won this world cup," hoots Mitch. "Can't wait to see how they pull it off!" I'm sure the BCCI have got something up their sleeve

4191___Here's Qasim: "In the last world cup one semi-final was a thriller and the other was one sided, this time around we already have had a thriller yesterday, hoping that history doesn't repeat and this is also a thriller."

4191___9.15am: Okay, time to get some preview content in front of your peepers, starting with our semi-final tactics board. We have also got George Dobell on the importance of England winning a trophy to go with the plaudits (carpe ODI-em, essentially); and Osman Samiuddin has been ruminating on fantasy cricketer Glenn Maxwell and England's under-the-radar hard-yards-merchant Liam Plunkett, the fast bowler you don't want to be. He's a thoughtful man, Os. We've also got the complete stats breakdown on what makes YJB and J-Roy so good.

4191___And here's Luke Hill: "So after volunteering at Old Trafford and meeting up with some of the cricinfo faithful, I'm back here in Berlin working away this morning. Luckily the Indian and Kiwi contingent got to watch their final yesterday, so as the token brit in the office, I get to watch the game today whilst ~working~ cheering on"

4191___"So excited about this one," yelps Cris R, "and if England win today, in their last three matches they will have defeated each of the other semi-finalists...not too shoddy!"

4191___9.25am: Okay, okay. What's the gut saying? This is pretty uncharted territory for England - while 1992 was within memory for some of us, it feels several lifetimes ago in cricketing terms. Australia, by contrast, are used to this. They've played knifey-spoony before. They've peaked at the right time and are gunning to set up a repeat of the 2015 final. Can England's mean machine find top gear or are Australia going to stick a spanner in the works?

4191___Feedback of the day, from PAUL CLEMENTS: "This World Cup would be done and dusted for England if only the Selectors had had the presence of mind to select Darren Stevens!! His feats with the ball this season for Kent are amazing. Perhaps he'll get a look in at the next one?"

4191___"England deserve to be favourites," muses Spencer. "BUT the weight of expectations might undo them. India would understand this." Indeed. Any India fans out there today? [Ducks behind sofa]

4191___Steve is also on a history-means-nothing trip: "You say we haven't won a knockout game since 1992... apart from the last 2 group stage games were essentially knockout matches..."

4191___"Can you please stop banging on about who has won what in previous world cups? It's entirely irrelevant unless you have the same players - which we don't." Nervous, Ryan?

4191___9.35am: We're a little under half an hour from the toss - which could be crucial, given how important a score on the board has become (the first semi-final now being exhibit A). England seem likely to field a settled side, but Australia have already been forced to call in Peter Handscomb... and there's some talk Maxwell could miss out for Matt Wade, too. (I know!) Anyway, we've also got the Live Report up and running, so you can get a dual serving of World Cup fever.

4191___"This will be game of the century. Two old rivals meeting in semis. Did they ever meet before in semi?" Oh dear, Imran. Don't ask Gary Gilmour that question

4191___Here's Dave Fern: "Can't wait for the toss and the match to get started. Really hope England can show up today, bat first and get off to a flying start. Australia are a tough team to face, but England can definitely beat them on a good day."

4191___"Any word on the pitch yet? Are we to assume that the captain that wins the toss will opt to bat first as seems to be the trend in this WC?" George reckons it will be a belter, Dean, but won't deteriorate too much. Let's hope the Sage of Edgbaston is right

4191___9.45am: We do, of course, have a reserve day for this semi, though the game isn't being played in Manchester, to we'll probably be all right (sorry, Gnasher). As well as some dodgy weather, and the difficulty chasing, this has also been the World Cup of the yorker. Mitchell Starc, anyone?

4191___Shankar: "Technically Aus have only won 6/7 semis, they tied one. Anyone remember that game?" Hmmm, rings a bell. Did someone get run out?

4191___And here's the Indian view, from Balu: "As an India supporter would like to see England playing NZ in Finals......let World Cup get a place in New Country......."

4191___"Morning Alan. Gosh this is soooo nerve wracking and we are only awaiting the toss!!!!!! What will I be like during the game??" Just imagine if England do get to the final, Rob...

4191___9.55am: Mark Wood has just received a commemorative cap for his 50th ODI. We've mentioned Starc, but England have a couple of genuine quicks these days, in Wood and Jofra Archer, who have played a big part in their success at this tournament. But who's going to run the Fast Show today?

4191___"Howdy, Alan," chirps SRS, "Indian fan here. As much a heartbreak that was yesterday, here's hoping Sunday would be a battle of potential first time winners. No nerves!"

4191___"Any word on the location of the pitch today? Have they gone for the fun of a pitch right on the edge again, or is it a more standard somewhere in the middle kind of thing today?" It's more towards the centre, Matt. So that short boundary shouldn't be such an issue

4191___10am: Toss time at Edgbaston, unlucky country for Australia. Can Finch get them off on the right foot?

4191___Australia: 1 Aaron Finch (capt), 2 David Warner, 3 Steven Smith, 4 Peter Handscomb, 5 Marcus Stoinis, 6 Glenn Maxwell, 7 Alex Carey (wk), 8 Pat Cummins, 9 Mitchell Starc, 10 Nathan Lyon, 11 Jason Behrendorff

4191___England: 1 Jason Roy, 2 Jonny Bairstow, 3 Joe Root, 4 Eoin Morgan (capt), 5 Ben Stokes, 6 Jos Buttler (wk), 7 Chris Woakes, 8 Liam Plunkett, 9 Adil Rashid, 10 Jofra Archer, 11 Mark Wood

4191___10.02am: Australia win the toss and bat, Aaron Finch and his men will get first use of the pitch. Just one change, with Peter Handscomb coming in for the injured Usman Khawaja. Finch reckons the pitch looks pretty good, but won't change too much. Eoin Morgan admits he would have also batted, but shrugs off his luck. "Not really bothered, before the World Cup we preferred to chase," he says. England as expected are unchanged.

4191___10.07am: First blood to Australia? Or can England break the chasing hoodoo...? Have your say on the Live Report and then it's over to the Match Day team for all their pre-match build-up via our live stream

4191___"Yes Shankar. Australia tied the 1999 semi-final with South Africa to proceed to the Final where they easily won against Pakistan at Lords." Good work, Ali. I think I've dug it out

4191___"Following up on the article regarding the sale of tickets, how much of the ground is full right now?" Well, Sahil, George Dobell says it is "much quieter than you would expect for an India game", no horns, vuvuzelas, etc but we don't yet know how many will come through the turnstiles

4191___Here's Billy, on the conundrum of Australia's misfiring middle order (which has got them this far, to be fair): "Surely Carey has to bat above Stoinis and Maxwell regardless of the situation. Those two have offered very little through the tournament "

4191___10.15am: Looks like a hard, oatmeal-coloured surface in use for today's semi-final. Good toss to win? A graveyard for bowlers? We'll soon find out. Australia's strength has been built on the gun-slinging qualities of openers Finch and David Warner (1100-plus runs between them)... but just as New Zealand proved yesterday, early wickets can dramatically alter preconceptions.

4191___10.20am: Osman reports on the atmosphere at Edgbaston: "More boos for Smith and Warner than there were cheers for England (or other Australian) players as the teams were announced at the stadium." There we go, they've set their stall out. And speaking of stalls to set out, it's time to welcome Deivarayan Muthu for his first spell of the day...

4191___10.25am Morning, ladies and gents. Thanks for the boos warm welcome Alan. I'm all warmed up. Australia and England players walk out with the mascots. Warner has a word with one of the kids. Time for the national anthems. First-up is Advance Australia Fair followed by God Save the Queen. Right, a spot in the final is on the line. Are you reaaaaaaady?

4191___Zameer Arif: "Last time Australia's top order collapsed, team were struggling. England can go for that. and New Zealand showed yesterday how to do it. There is no bits and pieces player to anchor them either."

4191___10.29am David Warner and Aaron Finch stride out to the middle. Chris Woakes is armed with the new ball. Can he find some swing or seam to bother Australia's openers? A couple of slips in place. Woakes runs in from over the wicket

4191___Woakes to Warner, FOUR runs, Warner is off and running with a first-ball four. Overpitched and slanting away outside off with the angle, Warner plunges forward and creams a drive in the gap at the covers

4191___Archer to Finch, OUT, Ooooooh, Finch has been given out lbw by umpire Dharmasena. Finch reckons he has snicked it? Finch has a word with Warner and challenges the on-field out decision. Archer begins with a full inswinger, Finch is very vulnerable to it, particularly early in his innings. Starts outside off and nips back in towards middle, Finch gets too far across, plays around his front pad, much like how Kohli did yesterday v Boult, and is struck on the flap of the front pad. This is cannoning into middle stump. The tracker returns three reads and off you go for a golden duck in the semi-final, Finch

Back of a length and slanting away outside off from over the wicket, explodes from the deck, seams away further. Warner is squared up. He fends at it and tickles it to second slip where YJB grabs a sharp chance in front of his face

Handscomb plays down the wrong line and is rapped on the front pad well above the knee-roll. Reckon height may be a concern here. Impact in line, but the tracker returns umpire's call on leg stump. So, England don't lose their review

4191___Well, then. That is barely a fighting score, but Australia aren't your regular brawlers. Can they do a New Zealand and upset the odds against a big-scoring opponent? They have twice defended lower totals to progress in World Cup semi-finals (although, unlike in 1999, a tie might not be enough). One thing we can be clear on: the first 10 overs here are crucial. Trevor Bayliss said a few days ago that his team weren't scared of chasing. What about the England fans out there? Nervous, much?

Lifter at the arm-pit of Roy, heading down the leg side, Roy aims a pull, but it's miles away from his reach. Good grab from Carey - injured jaw and all - but the question is was there bat on this? Replays suggest Roy did not touch it. England have lost their review and Roy has to go. He's seething, but umpire Erasmus chats with him and sends him off. He throws his gloves in the change room
