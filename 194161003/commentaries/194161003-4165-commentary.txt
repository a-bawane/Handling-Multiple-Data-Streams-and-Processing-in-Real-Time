4165___New Zealand have the best net run rate among the current top four (England, Australia, New Zealand, India), and with their last two league games against Australia and England, they wouldn't want to leave it too late A loss wouldn't yet mean certain exit for South Africa, but would put them perilously close to the edge. So, there's plenty on the line at Edgbaston. I'm Deivarayan Muthu and I'll be joined by Karthik Krishnaswamy to bring you all the action (hopefully not the rain-drop-by-raindrop action). Your first stop of the day should be Liam Brickhill's preview that has some tasty stats and strategic punts

4165___9.30am A rugby-mad nation turned into a cricket-loving country in 2015, when Brendon McCullum's men had the times of their lives in the previous World Cup. New Zealand cricket team and the public had the greatest time of their lives when Grant Elliott launched that six off Dale Steyn. Ecstasy for New Zealand - although the epic win meant their hero Elliott had to miss his sister's wedding - and agony for South Africa. Now, rewind to 2011. Mirpur, World Cup quarter-final: New Zealand knock out South Africa. What will the 2019 edition throw up? South Africa are teetering and have just one win to show for while New Zealand are unbeaten in this tournament.

4165___And if you're already bored of me, go and say hello to Liam Brickhill who is manning the #Livereport today

4165___Priya v: "Is Matt Henry playing today? My friend needs to lock her fantasy team in 10 minutes." --- Hmm, if the conditions are overcast enough to aid some swing, I'll swap him with Southee. No official word yet...

4165___9.35am Our weather expert correspondent Sid Monga: Cloudy day expected in Birmingham. It did rain last night, though.

4165___Tommo: "Hope to see Nicholls in for Neesham today, he would make me feel a lot more secure in our middle order... Southee in for Henry would be alright but has fallen behind Boult with the white ball since the 2015" --- What? Neesham won NZ their last completed game. If Nicholls has to come in, then he has to do so at the expense of Colin de Grandhomme.

4165___Doug: "Can i send out a happy birthday to our club's most colourful batsman Tom Ingham!! The WTTU club loves you and we are all hoping for dry weather and a Black Caps win!" --- Happy birthday, Tom!

4165___Anshul: "Hey Tommo! I can't allow you to drop Neesham as he is my captain in fantasy team. "

4165___Akash: "My Fantasy Team today: de kick, duplesis, van see dussen, Williamson , Taylor , guptill, santner, andill, hendricks, sodhi, boult...what do u think about it..will I win"

4165___9.45am New Zealand's old friend Jeetan Patel claimed 10 wickets in a county game for Warwickshire at this venue a couple of weeks back. Will NZ lean towards Sodhi in a twin-spin attack on what is expected to be a dry track today?

4165___Pranav : "Speaking generally the best batsman of most of the teams are batting at number 3 at the moment be it india, NZ, England or Bangladesh so its about the time i think faf or amla should start batting at number 3 just to play that "Glue" role around whom other batsmans can play around!! "

4165___Nasir Mahmud: "NZ so far do not face team like AUS, ENG, SA yet so their position will be change, that's for sure."

4165___Anil Sehrawat: "Those who are saying that NZ havnt faced any tough team till now, should ask captains of SA and WI about what they think about Bangladesh and how easy thier match was against them"

4165___Arnaud: "SA will make a mistake by playing Amla today. With Amla up front, vd Dussen only comes in at 5 and they need him in earlier."

4165___Steve : "I know its early in the tournament and some teams have played more games than others, but New Zealand have scored the lowest amount of total runs in the competition so far, scoring 558. At the other end of the spectrum England have scored 1641" --- Wow, haven't checked this, but the difference is stark

4165___Derrick : "South Africa have too many classy players to completely flop in this tournament. They will have to click at some point. Will today be that day? I don't think they have a choice."

4165___David Miller: It was phenomenal striking from Morgan. Nice to see other guys going and keep a tab on what's happening. We know we have to win all our games from now - and we've prepped well for that. No, I don't think it's about over-analysing, we haven't been at our best. We believe we can turn things around and qualify. It has been gloomy, but hopefully we can get a game and good game in

4165___Shoyeb Ansari: "Today is the day of MightyHash. I have feeling that SA gonna clinch this one with good margin..."

4165___9.55am The toss has been delayed due to a wet outfield. It isn't raining, though The pitch is being rolled, it's getting brighter, so Monga doesn't expect too many dramas. He says there will be an inspection at 10.15am. Refresh your homepage to catch our flagship show Match Day LIVE with Michael Hussey, Murali Kartik, Daniel Vettori and Albie Morkel.

4165___Pranav : "David Miller needs to be "Eoin morgan" of South Africa someone who can build an innings when needed or finish strong when top order gives a good platform!! "

4165___Deepak Gupta: "No Rain cool. I LIKE IT. REPEAT I LIKE IT. "

4165___10.10am NO RAIN, I REPEAT NO RAIN. The pitch is uncovered, it is that outfield that is damp. We will have an inspection in 5 minutes or thereabouts

4165___Carl Wells: "New Zealand has chased in every game so far. So the reason they have fewer runs on the board is we have bowled sides out cheaply. Our high run difference shows how well we have got them. Looking forward to a tougher test today. "

4165___Shikhar Pathak : "SA win today will open up fourth position race between Nz,SA, Bang, Pak, WI. Come on SA, make the account exciting again "

4165___Sandaru Herath: "@Shikhar dont underestimate Sri Lanka as well! The way they started against Aussies,showed that they can fight too.And currently they are ahead of Pak and WI in the points table!"

4165___Trav: "Kiwi following the cup in Sweden (while mowing lawns at work on a ride-on mower) thank God for Cricinfo. Can't wait. Fantastic build-up articles too" -- We aim to pleasure and readers like you make us who we are. Cheers

4165___Karthik: "@Sandaru - SL has a v weak bowling attack and even weaker batting. Barring the openers ( Kusal Perera is v inconsistent as well) there does not seem to be anyone who can contribute in high scoring games which is typical in english conditions. They are higher placed than WI and Pak only cos of 2 washouts both of which they would have likely lost."

4165___J.Subbu: "Wet outfield holding entire match to ransom.....yet again. " --- Story of the World Cup?

4165___Nawaz: "It will remain dry for next couple of hours at least (I hope)"

4165___Ankur: "I am going to go out on a limb here, NZ are unbeaten in tournament, they will easily make it to semis, Australia, on the other hand will struggle in next few games, and their game against Bangladesh will decide the 4th semifinalist "

4165___10.16am The umpires Llong and Gould make their way out to the middle for the inspection. Du Plessis and Williamson are still in their tracksuits. The pitch and the infield seem okay, is the outfield dry enough for a start? It's overcast but dry. We will have another inspection at 11am local

4165___Sudarshan: "When NZ won the 2015 WC semifinals, I did not know whether to feel happy that they won or to feel sad that South Africa had lost another knockout game despite playing amazing cricket ! Hope they produce another classic here!"

4165___    It was the greatest moment for the sport in New Zealand, a rugby nation that was won over during the tournament by the Brendon McCullum brand of cricket - aggressive, inspired, played with a smile. It was also a stab through the collective soul of the South Africa cricketers, with their wretched baggage of knockout losses. As a neutral, you felt the tug from both ends.

4165___    In sport, someone's triumph is inevitably someone else's tragedy. When Grant Elliott, a journeyman cricketer from South Africa who had made New Zealand his home, carted Dale Steyn, one of South Africa's greatest bowlers, over wide long-on in Auckland in the first semi-final, the euphoria and the heartbreak were both amplified.

4165___While we wait for the outfield to dry why not read Sambit Bal's latest entry on the WC writer's notebook: New Zealand, South Africa, the last time

4165___More good news: the sun peeks into Edgbaston

4165___10.20am Umpires Gould and Llong: The story is we have inspected and it has improved without doubt. It has given us hope. It hasn't stopped raining for the best part of the week, there are wet patches on the field and greasy - hopefully, the sun comes out. Basically it's the wet outfield - the entire outfield. We're giving the groundsmen the best time to prepare the field and let the sun and wind dry it out.

4165___Kartik: "Deiva, is Sharda Ugra lurking at the ground by any chance? Then you might want to ask her to leave. Ever since I read her article about her being the rain bringer, I'm worried about her presence" --- Ha! Sharda isn't around at Edgbaston. Messrs Monga and Fidel have brought some sunshine. Once the outfield is dry enough, we will get some action

4165___10.45am *Drum rolls* Sid Monga brings all of us great news from Edgbaston: "Proper sunshine now."

4165___When Grant Elliott was playing a blinder against South Africa to launch New Zealand into the 2015 World Cup final, Colin Munro, who had missed out on a place in the national squad, was shellacking a record 23 sixes while scoring 281 from 167 balls for Auckland against Central Districts in the four-day Plunket Shield. He has been a sought-after name in T20 leagues, but can he adjust to 50-over cricket and conditions in England? The Tahir threat looms large.

4165___11am Born in Durban. Turning up for New Zealand in a key World Cup clash against South Africa. Big day for Colin Munro. He wasn't supposed to start the tournament, but a niggling injury to first-choice opener Henry Nicholls shook up NZ's plans and Munro was suddenly among the runs.

4165___11.03am Umpires Llong and Gould are back for another inspection. "South Africa were preparing to start their warm-ups. Greg King, their trainer, was walking out with the cones, but Nigel Llong just waved him away," says Monga. Okay, King has now been given the thumbs up. Du Plessis walks out for warm-up, windmilling his bat. Several players join him in the warm-up. We might not be too far away from a start. Yay! We will have a toss at 11.30am and it will be a 49-overs-per-side contest. And on that positive note, say hello to Karthik Krishnaswamy.

4165___"2015 Grant Elliott played winning knock. 2019 Colin Munro?? Both are South Africa-born." -- Quite possible, Mani. Quite possible. My gut feeling is a big Quinton de Kock hundred.

4165___The three Powerplays, by the way, will be from overs 1-10, 11-39, and 40-49.

4165___11.07am Hello, everyone. The toss will be at 11.30am local time, in case we confused you with our time-zone mix-up. We cannot wait!

4165___Munwar: "NZ and SA are my two favourite cricket-playing nations, after my country India. Seeing any of these two nations losing a match makes me feel bad. Today I don't know whom to support. I want NZ to win but I don't want SA to lose."

4165___KG: "@Munwar mate rain is the best chance for that to happen!"

4165___11.20am Sri Lanka have been opening the batting with their captain and their keeper at this World Cup. Has it ever happened before? Well, Ask Steven!

4165___Ela: "Back in school I loved green so SA become my favourite team. Now that I grew up and started listening heavy metal black has become my favourite. But my affection towards proteas has only grown. Irony is I like them in pink as they have played better in pink. "

4165___Thomas: "Out of all the South African World Cup nightmares 2015 was the worst. Seeing Morkel and AB in tears was heartbreaking. Hoping for tears of joy this time..."

4165___Du Plessis says he would have bowled first too. "A bit of blue sky about, so hopefully the ball will come on to the bat." One change for South Africa. Lungi Ngidi is in. Not sure who's out yet. We'll let you know ASAP. I'm guessing it's Beuran Hendricks. Yup. No Hendricks.

4165___It's Williamson to toss. Du Plessis calls heads, and it's tails. New Zealand will bowl first. "A little bit of weather around, but looks like a fair surface, which is usually the case here," Williamson says. New Zealand are unchanged.

4165___11.30am It's that time of day: Faf, Kane, and a coin.

4165___Shishir : "2011 Quarter Final, 2015 Semi Final and now must win match for South Africa!! Will Kiwis stop Proteas in CWC campaign third time in a row?"

4165___Nico Myburgh : "What is your favorite battle today? Rabada vs Williamson, Boult vs De Kock, Tahir vs his PB sprinting time? Any other worth mentioning? " -- Not a battle, but I'm always stirred by the sight of Ross Taylor's GM with its old-school black grip.

4165___Tinu: "That face of Lance Klusener in 1999... That was the saddest SA has ever produced." -- Shaun Pollock behind his laptop in 2003 was pretty gutting too.

4165___Duard: "I hope Quinny and Hash can get their act together for this vital match!"

4165___Mark: "My favourite battle? Taylor vs Williamson. Who runs out who?" -- Ha!

4165___Piyush: "Amla requires 24 runs to become the second fastest to score 8000 ODI runs; fastest being Virat Kohli. Will he able to do so today? I doubt! " -- Never doubt the great Hashim!

4165___Caleb: "When will Henry Nicholls get a chance this World Cup? He's been good and getting better and was doing well at opening until his injury. Munro never seems to fulfil his potential in the medium-length format."

4165___Jeremy: "Interesting match up. Seriously underperforming SA against (some say) untested NZ. Form says there can be only one winner, but I'm not so sure. Not seen the odds yet, but a punt on SA might be a profitable hunch."

4165___Sarath: "I think SA will open bowling with Tahir, as both NZ openers not known to be explosive against spin." -- Quite possible, yes.

4165___South Africa: 1 Hashim Amla, 2 Quinton de Kock (wk), 3 Aiden Markram, 4 Faf du Plessis (capt), 5 Rassie van der Dussen, 6 David Miller, 7 Andile Phehlukwayo, 8 Chris Morris, 9 Kagiso Rabada, 10 Lungi Ngidi, 11 Imran Tahir

4165___New Zealand: 1 Martin Guptill, 2 Colin Munro, 3 Kane Williamson (capt), 4 Ross Taylor, 5 Tom Latham (wk), 6 James Neesham, 7 Colin de Grandhomme, 8 Mitchell Santner, 9 Matt Henry, 10 Lockie Ferguson, 11 Trent Boult

4165___11.40am Here are the teams:

4165___Matt Henry has the first new ball. Two slips in place for de Kock.

4165___11.56pm The anthems are done, and we're good to go. Get on your favourite couch, and have your favourite beverage handy. You don't want to take your eyes off this contest. Hashim Amla and Quinton de Kock are making their way out to the middle now. A few bits of grey in the sky, but it's fairly sunny otherwise.

4165___Henry to de Kock, no run, back of a length, angling across to off stump, opens up a little to try and work it leg side, but he's working against the angle and decides to defend instead

4165___0

4165___0.1

4165___Henry to de Kock, no run, ooh, that's a loose shot. Fuller, but still on a good length, and a lot wider. Throws an angled bat at it and he's lucky not to edge that

4165___0

4165___0.2

4165___Henry to de Kock, 1 run, length ball on off stump, uses his wrists to work it into the backward square leg region

4165___1

4165___0.3

4165___Henry to Amla, no run, back of a length, fifth-stump line, steep bounce. Amla lifts his bat high over his head to ensure the ball's safe passage through to the keeper

4165___0

4165___0.4

4165___Henry to Amla, FOUR runs, too straight, stays onto Amla's hip, and he tucks it away easily to the fine leg boundary. The fielder there is pretty fine, but not fine enough

4165___4

4165___0.5

4165___Henry to Amla, no run, length ball, fifth-stump line, left alone

4165___0

4165___0.6

4165___    Quinton de Kock1 (3b)

4165___    Hashim Amla4 (3b)

4165___END OF OVER:1 | 5 Runs | SA: 5/0 | RR: 5.00

4165___I Goosen: "NZ anthem giving me flashbacks to All Blacks vs Springboks last year! Two insane games, each team winning one. Lets go Proteas!!"

4165___Here's Trent Boult. Two slips for him too as he comes in from left-arm over to de Kock.

4165___Boult to de Kock, no run, full on off stump, clipped to mid-on

4165___0

4165___1.1

4165___Boult to de Kock, no run, full again, a bit of late swing in to the left-hander, towards leg stump. Gets his front foot out of the way in time and clips to mid-on

4165___0

4165___1.2

4165___Boult to de Kock, FOUR runs, too straight. A full one straying onto the pads, and de Kock works it nice and fine, and fine leg once again has no chance

4165___4

4165___1.3

4165___Boult to de Kock, no run, back of a length, angling into middle and leg. Clipped to midwicket

4165___0

4165___1.4

4165___Q de Kock b Boult 5 (8m 8b 1x4 0x6) SR: 62.50

4165___Boult to de Kock, OUT, bowled him, stumps flying all over the place! He's been looking for that full one angling in towards leg stump all through the over, and he bowls another. De Kock leaves a bit of a hole in his attempted on-drive - the result of his front foot not really getting forward at all - and the ball simply bursts through. Judging by how the rest of the over's gone, a definite plan from Boult - something to do with de Kock's lack of feet movement early on, and maybe the angle that his bat comes down at, from around gully or thereabouts

4165___W

4165___1.5

4165___Faf du Plessis walks in at No. 3.

4165___Boult to du Plessis, 2 runs, gets a full one first up, outside off, and he gets a good stride out to drive with an open face to the left of extra-cover. Big mix-up between the batsmen - not sure when exactly, because the TV pictures are a complete muddle - but Faf dives and makes his ground in time to beat his throw to the keeper

4165___Henry to Amla, no run, back of a length close to off stump, hops in the air and defends towards backward point

4165___0

4165___2.2

4165___Henry to Amla, no run, in the blockhole close to off stump, jams down without too much fuss and keeps it out

4165___0

4165___2.3

4165___Gagan: "Where's the guy that was forecasting a De Kock hundred?" - Bringing you the ball-by-ball commentary, that's where.

4165___Henry to Amla, 1 run, length ball, quite wide outside off. No real front-foot stride to drive through the covers, and he sends a thick inside edge running away towards fine leg instead

4165___1

4165___2.4

4165___Henry to du Plessis, no run, full, angling into middle and leg, keeps his front leg out of the way and shows the full face to block it back to the bowler

4165___0

4165___2.5

4165___Henry to du Plessis, no run, ooh, that's a tight leave. On the shorter side of a good length, with a bit of nip back in. Doesn't seem to miss the top of off stump by much

4165___0

4165___END OF OVER:3 | 1 Run | SA: 12/1 | RR: 4.00

4165___Hamish: "Boult has dismissed de Kock five times in ODIs now." Yup. In just eight innings!

4165___Boult to Amla, 2 runs, short, but on a tight line close to off stump. Jumps to ride the bounce and just meets it with a vertical bat to send it rolling away between backward point and cover point

4165___2

4165___3.1

4165___Boult to Amla, no run, length ball, slanting away a touch wider. Left alone

4165___0

4165___3.2

4165___Anshul Dave : "Myy fantasy team vice captain has taken out my captain. Dont know whether be happy or sad" -- That's how life mostly works, mate.

4165___Boult to Amla, 1 run, shortish, at the body. Whipped off the hip to fine leg

4165___1

4165___3.3

4165___Boult to du Plessis, no run, wide length ball, left alone. Could have been called wide, but isn't

4165___0

4165___3.4

4165___Boult to du Plessis, no run, nicely bowled. Not quite as wide as the previous one, and on a length that's juuust short of drive-able. Two slips in place, and Faf ignores the bait

4165___0

4165___3.5

4165___Boult to du Plessis, no run, back of a length close to off stump, defended into the point region

4165___END OF OVER:4 | 3 Runs | SA: 15/1 | RR: 3.75

4165___Henry to Amla, no run, another wide-ish length ball - sixth stump or thereabouts - and Amla leaves it alone

4165___0

4165___4.1

4165___Henry to Amla, no run, ooh, some swing on this occasion. On the fuller side of a good length, inviting the cover drive away from the body. Amla goes for it, and the ball swerves past his outside edge

4165___0

4165___4.2

4165___Henry to Amla, 3 runs, full, angling into off stump. Amla looks for the cover drive, a hands shot with feet going nowhere. The ball doesn't swing this time - he's playing for swing - and it runs away through midwicket off the inside edge. Big gap between bat and pad - that could easily have gone through

4165___3

4165___4.3

4165___Henry to du Plessis, no run, length ball outside off, a bit of outswing. Faf leaves it alone

4165___0

4165___4.4

4165___Henry to du Plessis, no run, a touch shorter, swerves away sharply from a fifth-stump line, left alone

4165___END OF OVER:5 | 3 Runs | SA: 18/1 | RR: 3.60

4165___A wide gully in place now for Boult. No slips.

4165___Boult to Amla, no run, Ooh, that's some sharp inswing. A fullish length, and once again Amla's front foot goes nowhere. Tries to flick it hurriedly, following the swing, but his front pad is in the way. No appeal - the impact was outside leg stump and the ball was missing leg too

4165___0

4165___5.1

4165___Boult to Amla, no run, full on leg stump, clipped to midwicket

4165___0

4165___5.2

4165___Boult to Amla, no run, length ball on middle and off, shuffles across and defends into the on side

4165___0

4165___5.3

4165___Faf du Plessis finished the 2015 World Cup with an average of 36. He's bulked that up to 46 now thanks to a really good last four years. In that time, he's even made public a wish to move from a good player to a great player and that's the focus whenever he trains.

4165___Boult to Amla, 2 runs, looks for that full inswinger again, ends up a touch too straight, and Amla clips it off his toes to the left of fine leg

4165___2

4165___5.4

4165___Boult to Amla, no run, length ball, straightens a little along the fourth-stump line. Defended off the front foot, into the covers

4165___5.5

4165___Gully's moved to slip now. And Guptill is at a catching short midwicket.

4165___Boult to Amla, no run, length ball swinging in towards middle and off. Gets behind it and clips to square leg

4165___Henry to du Plessis, no run, fullish on off stump, du Plessis plays a good-looking checked drive to mid-off

4165___0

4165___6.1

4165___Henry to du Plessis, no run, back of a length close to off stump, did that keep a tiny bit low? Du Plessis jams his bat down quickly and jabs towards midwicket, off the inside half of the bat

4165___0

4165___6.2

4165___Henry to du Plessis, no run, length ball swinging away lavishly, but the initial line is wide enough for du Plessis not to get drawn into playing at it

4165___0

4165___6.3

4165___Henry to du Plessis, no run, length ball, fifth-stump line, not as much swing - more a hit-the-deck type of ball. Du Plessis leaves again

4165___0

4165___6.4

4165___Henry to du Plessis, 2 runs, ooh, that's a good ball. Full, fuller than half-volley length, and it swings away late from just outside off. Du Plessis was looking for a drive through mid-on, and he ended up opened up and edging thickly to the left of third man, where Lockie Ferguson makes a good attempt at a diving save. Looks like he's juuust kept it in with a strong swish of his left hand

4165___0

4165___7.2

4165___Boult to Amla, FOUR runs, shot! Given that Amla doesn't really get on the front foot to most deliveries, bowlers can occasionally try and go fuller to try and draw him forward. This one's got a bit of width on it, though, and not much swing back in, and Amla waves his wand of a bat at it - it's a diagonal bat, but does it matter when he connects so cleanly? - and sends it racing away through cover point

4165___4

4165___7.3

4165___Round the wicket now.

4165___Boult to Amla, FOUR runs, bam. Overpitches, on off stump, and Amla just shows it the full face and finds the gap to the right of mid-off

4165___7.4

4165___Back over the wicket.

4165___Boult to Amla, no run, length ball angling across towards off stump, gets across and behind it and defends into the covers

4165___7.5

4165___Boult to Amla, 1 run, ooh, good ball. Good length, slanting across into the corridor, and gets some extra bounce. Takes the shoulder of the bat as Amla props half-forward to defend, but he plays with soft hands and it doesn't carry to the fielder at slip

4165___8.1

4165___Sam : "Lots of talk and articles written about bat dominating ball, but there have been some brilliant fast bowling in this World Cup. " -- Indeed. Boult and Henry have been pretty good too, so far, and bowled a fuller length than most teams at the tournament. Lots of leaves - tells you how much it's swinging, and that these two have batted pretty well too.

4165___Henry to Amla, no run, good length again, closer to off stump. Judges it well and leaves it again

4165___0

4165___Boult to du Plessis, FOUR runs, full outside off, and that's a good shot even though it isn't off the middle of the bat. It isn't a half-volley, and it's swinging back in, but du Plessis got a big stride forward, ensuring he reduced the width of the swing at the point of impact, and the ball rolled away to the right of mid-off off the inside half of the bat

4165___4

4165___4

4165___Boult to Amla, no run, beauty. He's been getting consistent swing back into the right-hander, and this one just keeps going with the angle. Back of a length, pitching within the stumps and slanting away, and it beats the outside edge as Amla aims a back-foot punch at it

4165___Henry to du Plessis, no run, Henry makes du Plessis play and beats the outside edge. Good length, angling in close to off as du Plessis wafts at it. But the ball straightens away so very late to skip past the outside edge. Excellent bowling from Henry

4165___0

4165___10.4

4165___2

4165___43.1

4165___Boult to Miller, no run, misses out. On the shorter side of a length, but plenty of width, and he slaps it straight to extra-cover. There's an appeal for a run-out at the non-striker's end... VDD had raced out of his crease, and was sent back by Miller. Makes it home with a sprawling dive by the time Boult collects and breaks the stumps

4165___0

4165___43.2

4165___Boult to Miller, 1 run, short, rising ball over off stump, pulled hard into the turf, and the man at midwicket moves to his right to stop it. It's towards Santner's wrong hand, and they take on the quick single. Santner's throw misses anyway, with Miller diving to complete the run

4165___1

4165___Boult to Miller, SIX runs, shot. That's very well played. Boult's angling this full ball into leg stump, looking to deny Miller room to free his arms, but Miller clears his front leg, and makes light of the lack of room with a bottom-hand shovel that carries all the way over the straight midwicket boundary

4165___4

4165___Ferguson to Miller, OUT, makes himself plenty of room and Ferguson bangs in a short ball, slanting away from Miller. The ball is rising steeply, and he's moving away from it's line, so he can't quite control the uppercut, ends up offering a catch to third man moving to his left. Good innings, though. He's given South Africa a bit of momentum

4165___0

4165___45.1

4165___Boult to Phehlukwayo, 1 leg bye, looks for the leg-stump yorker, gets a bit of inward reverse but the line's a little too straight. Tickled down to fine leg, not sure if it was bat or boot

4165___1lb

4165___45.2

4165___Boult to van der Dussen, no run, extra bounce from a short length. Ends up cramped for room trying to pull a shoulder-high ball, ends up gloving it into his helmet grille. Ouch. Out comes the physio to check on van der Dussen's right thumb. A liberal application of magic spray

4165___0

4165___45.3

4165___Yoga: "I always felt that Miller is like Raina for India, comes to bat often after 30th over sometimes after 40, has to keep the run rate right from the 1st ball, when trying to accelerate gets out mostly in 30s and some 50s and rarely gets a big one. And not the least a left handed and similar batting position." -- Pretty good comparison. Both have their technical limitations, but it's a difficult job and they've often done a very good job of it.

4165___Van der Dussen is ready to face again.

4165___Boult to van der Dussen, FOUR runs, and he absolutely smashes this. Poor ball from Boult, half-volley on off stump, and he clears his front leg, leans back, and wallops this between the umpire and the non-striker

4165___4

4165___45.4

4165___Boult to van der Dussen, 1 run, full on middle stump, fuller than the previous ball so he doesn't have the same room to hit it. Driven past the stumps at the other end but this time long-on can move around to stop it

4165___1

4165___Ferguson to Phehlukwayo, OUT, gone. Mid-off was in the circle, and he gets a full-toss from Ferguson, but it's at an awkward height, about two-thirds of a stump high, and it's quick - 144kph - so he's denied swinging room. Goes hard at it, the ball comes off the bat with a dull clunk, and Williamson takes an easy chest-high catch at mid-off

4165___46.4

4165___Ferguson to Morris, no run, beaten again. Makes a lot of room to try and slash over point, but this shortish one, over middle stump, is mid-140s again, and he's a touch late on the shot

4165___END OF OVER:47 | 2 Runs 1 Wkt | SA: 218/6 | RR: 4.63

4165___Brilliant over from Ferguson, only two off it plus the wicket of Phehlukwayo. Can Henry follow up with another good'un?

4165___Henry to van der Dussen, SIX runs, length ball on off stump, and Rassie puts it away. Clears his front leg and hoicks it over the square leg boundary. Dragged it much squarer than intended, off the inner half, but the square boundary on that side is pretty short

4165___6

4165___47.1

4165___Henry to van der Dussen, 1 run, slower short ball, angling into the body, and that's dropped on the fine leg boundary. Pulled in the air, and Ferguson, coming in off the boundary and sliding forward on his knees, is in a good position to take it above his lap, but he spills it despite getting both hands under it

4165___1

4165___47.2

4165___Third man and fine leg are up now for Morris.

4165___Henry to Morris, 1 run, digs it in, back of a length, must have been the slower one, and Morris, looking to make room to free his arms, can only flat-bat it down the ground to long-on

4165___1

4165___47.3

4165___Henry to van der Dussen, no run, slower ball, fullish and fairly wide of off. Looks to go down on his back knee and heave it over midwicket, but he swings too early and only manages to send an inside-edge rolling to the keeper

4165___0

4165___47.4

4165___Henry to van der Dussen, no run, another slower one, shorter and closer to off stump. Grips the turf and keeps a little low, and van der Dussen ends up swinging above it, looking to pull

4165___0

4165___47.5

4165___Henry to van der Dussen, no run, another slower one, fuller this time, but again wide of off stump. Van der Dussen looks to reverse-sweep, but can't connect yet again

4165___Final over coming up, and it's Ferguson to finish. Can South Africa get to 240?

4165___Ferguson to Morris, FOUR runs, maybe they can. Short one, gets up to shoulder height outside off. Morris looks to fetch a pull from there, ends up top-edging it to the fine third-man boundary

4165___4

4165___48.1

4165___Third man, fine leg, deep point, deep square leg, and long-on are the boundary fielders.

4165___Ferguson to Morris, no run, he wants to make room and go over mid-off, but this is quick and banged in short, so it rises above his attempt at a flat-bat hit over mid-off

4165___0

4165___48.2

4165___Ferguson to Morris, 1 run, makes room again and Ferguson attempts to follow him with a back-of-a-length slower ball. Too early into his flat-bat hit, and it rolls to mid-off off the toe end

4165___1

4165___48.3

4165___Ferguson to van der Dussen, no run, now Rassie makes a lot of room, and Ferguson bowls another slowie - the legcutter is his go-to variety - pretty full outside off. Big swing, looking to go over mid-off, and he misses

4165___0

4165___48.4

4165___Ferguson to van der Dussen, SIX runs, wham, that sounded so good off the bat. Looks to make room again, and Ferguson goes short. But it sits up at chest height, within the batsman's hitting arc, and he absolutely hammers it over long-on

4165___6

4165___48.5

4165___Ferguson to van der Dussen, FOUR runs, great finish from van der Dussen. Looks to make room again, and this time Ferguson tries to go full. Doesn't get it full enough, and he can get underneath it and drive it hard, back over the bowler's head. Mid-off is up, and long-on is too wide, so it runs away for four to edge South Africa past 240

4165___Rabada to Munro, FOUR runs, hang up the caution, NZ! Very full and angling across off, Munro spanks it through the line. Latches onto the width and utterly batters it through the covers

4165___4

4165___Ngidi to Guptill, no run, welcome back, Ngidi. On a length, angling in, bouncing at off, tricks Guptill into playing the incoming angle. But this hits the pitch and wickedly straightens past the outside edge. Cracker first-up from Ngidi

4165___1

4165___1.3

4165___Indeed I am. This is turning out to be a proper old-school dogfight, kind of like that other famous South Africa ODI at Edgbaston... Here's Rabada.

4165___Rabada to Williamson, no run, short, rising ball close to off stump. Gets off his feet to ride the bounce, manages to keep it down in front of Amla at slip

4165___0

4165___30.1

4165___0

4165___30.5

4165___Rabada to Neesham, no run, bit of an appeal for caught behind. A short one at around chest height, hops up and across to try and glance it fine, and I don't know what it hit, but there was a faint suggestion of something - thigh pad? - on it. Not the most convincing appeal from de Kock, and Rabada wasn't hugely excited either

4165___Morris returns.

4165___Morris to Williamson, 1 run, there's that lovely Williamson drive again, on the up, except the ball is still stopping occasionally off this pitch, and it briefly hangs in the air on its way to mid-off, making Morris put his head in his hands

4165___JDS Neesham c Amla b Morris 23 (60m 34b 3x4 0x6) SR: 67.64

4165___Morris to Neesham, OUT, gone! Steered straight to the man at wide slip! Morris' over-the-wicket angle to the left-handers has picked up another wicket. Cross-seam, just short of a length, angling away from off stump, and Neesham leans back and steers it, probably looking for third man, but the ball bounces a little more than he'd like and he ends up hitting it straight into Amla's lap. Takes it well, falling to his left

4165___W

4165___32.2

4165___Another big drop in our Forecaster prediction. New Zealand's win probability falls from 65.9% to 48.5% with that wicket.

4165___32.3

4165___Morris to de Grandhomme, FOUR runs, what a shot. What. A. Shot. It's overpitched, yes, on middle stump, but to time it like that, wow. Flicks it, casual as you'd like, and it almost carries all the way to the square midwicket boundary

4165___Imran Tahir to Williamson, 1 run, slower flight, googly, Williamson stretches forward and clips gently to the right of midwicket.

4165___Long-on, third man, and square leg are back on the rope for CdG.

4165___Phehlukwayo to de Grandhomme, SIX runs, You can put everyone in the world on the boundary, and it won't matter. Short ball, gets up to about chest height, and de Grandhomme is onto it so quickly, swivels and deposits it waaaaaaaay beyond the square leg boundary, up in the back rows

Waaaait, replays show Williamson bottom edged it! De Kock didn't hear it. Tahir is appealing. He's shocked no one joins him and South Africa have missed out on a big big biiiiiiiiig break

4165___END OF OVER:39 | 10 Runs | NZ: 183/5 (59 runs required from 60 balls, RR: 4.69, RRR: 5.90)

4165___Right, we're into the final stage of the innings. Five fielders allowed on the boundary now. New Zealand need 59 off 60 balls. South Africa need five wickets

4165___Ngidi to Williamson, no run, kicks up on Williamson, cramping him on off stump, and the New Zealand captain dabs it to the wicketkeeper's right

4165___0

4165___39.2

4165___Ngidi to Williamson, no run, brings his wrists into play to deal with a slower ball looking for the top of off stump. Works it to midwicket

4165___0

4165___39.3

4165___Third man back, mid-on up

4165___Ngidi to Williamson, no run, another slower ball, and it sticks in the pitch, making Williamson's push to mid-on travel in the air for a distance. This is on a knife edge, people. South Africa can still make up for missing that review to get Williamson caught behind

4165___0

4165___39.4

4165___Ngidi to Williamson, no run, full, slow and on off stump. Williamson blocks towards point. Good stuff. They realise the pitch is helping them when pace is taken of it

4165___END OF OVER:40 | 1 Run | NZ: 184/5 (58 runs required from 54 balls, RR: 4.60, RRR: 6.44)

4165___Right then, it's down to NZ needing 58 off 54 balls with five wickets in the shed. Fasten your seat belts for this could be another blockbuster between these two sides

4165___Rabada to Williamson, 1 leg bye, Oh my, a comedy of errors at Edgbaston. Awful mix-up between the wickets. Miller fluffs a run-out chance and reprieves Williamson. This was another well-directed short ball at the body, comes off pretty slow off the surface. Williamson is early into the pull and wears it on his body. De Grandhomme wants a single, Williamson doesn't. Rabada, the bowler himself, swoops down on the ball. The throw is to Miller at the non-striker's end. He is in a rush. He is under pressure. He dislodges the bails without collecting the ball. What a big miss for SA. Is that the game?

He turns out for Birmingham Bears in the T20 tournament here. Who writes your scrips, man? What an innings under pressure. Back of a length and outside off, he swats it away like a fly

4165___Ngidi to de Grandhomme, OUT, South Africa finally hang onto a catch. Faf du Plessis gives SA hope. Oh man, what a game this is turning out to be! This is the slower one once again. Pitched up and outside off, right up the alley for de Grandhomme to muscle it into the stands. He only holes out to long-off. Is there another twist in this match?

4165___W

4165___47.1

4165___Here comes Mitchell Santner. He is so cool and laidback that he has been nicknamed "Flatline" at Northern Districts. A slip greets him. Mid-off sent back

4165___Ngidi to Williamson, no run, Has that been dropped by Ngidi? Nope, that did not carry to him and he wears a wry smile. Slower cutter, grips in the pitch, chipped back, lands just in front of the bowler

4165___WATCH - Williamson survives again as South Africa blow a run-out chance (Australia, UK and SEA only)

4165___Ngidi to Williamson, FOUR runs, That artistic dab from Williamson fetches him a crucial four. Slower ball, Ngidi rolls his fingers across the ball and pushes it outside off, Williamson waits for the ball to arrive, then glides it - like only he can - fine of short third man for four. First boundary for Williamson after 38 balls, I'm told. Significant one

4165___Long-on, long-off, two men in the deep on the leg side, sweeper cover in the deep. No short third man or deep third man

4165___New Zealand need 8 off the last over. Can they have the times of their lives once again? Andile will bowl the final over. Faf has a lengthy discussion with him. Okay, guess what the ZING BAILS have stopped play. Scenes at Edgbaston. Sid Monga from the venue: "They are taking the bail from the non-strikers' end to the striker's end. I am not sure the zing is working on the bails now"

4165___Phehlukwayo to Santner, 1 run, hip-high short ball on middle, Santner pulls and finds deep midwicket

4165___1

4165___48.1

4165___Phehlukwayo to Williamson, SIX runs, Grant Elliott: 2015. Kane Williamson: 2019. New Zealand are having the times of their lives once again. What an incredible century from Kane Williamson. This was full and outside off, slower variation, Williamson picks it, drops down to one knee and smokes it away into the stands beyond midwicket. Williamson eases the helmet off his head and soaks everything in

4165___6

4165___48.2

4165___Phehlukwayo to Williamson, FOUR runs, Williamson - you beauty! It had to end this way, right? That dab down to third man. Back of a length and outside off, glides it away behind point and seals it for NZ like boss. He is the boss. Meanwhile, South Africa's World Cup hopes are effectively ended
