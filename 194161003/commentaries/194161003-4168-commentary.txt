4168___Shikhar Pathak : "There will be some swing available in Leeds in the morning. If Eng bat first and SLanka gets 3-4 wickets in first hour, they might be then able to restrict under 400 " - whoa. That's looking at Sri Lanka's cup as - 1/10th full?

4168___Rahul Shrivasta: "So Swann says that England team believes even 500 is possible. I want England to bat first. Eagerly waiting to watch that happen. An Indian fan who really admire the current English team...."

4168___RiwajAdhikari: "Well a SL fan from Nepal here and dunno why have I got a feeling today that SL can do this. Yes there might be some hiccups but hope the 'out of the box' tactic works in our favour to get the result for SL!"

4168___9.48am: George Dobell tells me that England are going to be unchanged. So they're going to come full throttle at Sri Lanka. It also means Jason Roy has still not recovered.

4168___9.56am: It's a beautiful day, Wasim Akram says it's a "batting day". The pitch is hard, with not much grass on it, and Akram says the team winning the toss should bat first. Big totals expected.

4168___Sri Lanka could possibly bring in Avishka Fernando and Jeevan Mendis, in place of Lahiru Thirimanne and Milinda Siriwardana. But we'll know in a matter of minutes. Toss time almost.

4168___Eoin Morgan: I would have looked to do the same, it's the best time to bat early. We've got with the same line-up as Old Trafford. It gives a little bit of turn, which brings Adil and Moeen into the game. Our first priority is to get into the semifinals and if we do that, we might look at who gets to rest. (Moeen) is absolutely buzzing today and thoroughly deserves his 100th cap.

4168___Dimuth Karunaratne: We've got two changes, Lahiru and Milinda aren't playing. We've had some time to regroup and discuss about what went wrong. We were worried about it (the middle order) but I'm pretty confident we'll bounce back.

4168___Surath: "Dear SL team, doesn't matter what the result is, please try to bat full 50 overs today and that will make us happy. One step at a time. Thanks "

4168___Peter: "How can you call it uncompetitive. Four teams all with a good chance of winning. The favourites are magnificent on their day, but Pakistan have shown they can be susceptible to good opposition. "

4168___Sri Lanka: 1 Dimuth Karunaratne (capt), 2 Kusal Perera (wk), 3 Avishka Fernando, 4 Kusal Mendis, 5 Angelo Mathews, 6 Jeevan Mendis, 7 Dhananjaya de Silva, 8 Thisara Perera, 9 Isuru Udana, 10 Lasith Malinga, 11 Nuwan Pradeep

4168___England: 1 Jonny Bairstow, 2 James Vince, 3 Joe Root, 4 Eoin Morgan (capt), 5 Ben Stokes, 6 Jos Buttler (wk), 7 Moeen Ali, 8 Chris Woakes, 9 Adil Rashid, 10 Jofra Archer, 11 Mark Wood

4168___Playing XIs:

4168___10.02 am: Sri Lanka win the toss and bat first

4168___10.12am: We're soon going to see Jofra Archer steaming in - well he doesn't steam as much as amble - and letting loose his 145kph deliveries. There was a time when Archer was sleeping on the floor of his friend's room, searching for avenues to play. It's been quite a journey from that to being England's great World Cup hope.

4168___Angelo Mathews: it's been very tough and boring to be honest, not getting on the park, two games being washed out. Hopefully we can play some good cricket today. Apart from the openers, none of the batters have responded well, including myself. We take ownership for that and we'll look to get it right this game. We don't go out there to fail purposely, we try our very best, but unfortunately it doesn't come off sometimes. We've got to fight fire with fire with the English boys. They are playing their best at the moment. You've got to play positive cricket. You can't do much skillwork with the limited time we've got, it's just a mental shift that we need.

4168___Vinod Rajpal: "Another England match with 100% clear weather !!" - the weather's coming home...

4168___Rahul Shrivasta: "Tell u what, Archer is definitely going to be in top 3 wicket takers this WC. He has an awesome career head if he just keeps his head grounded and straight" - from whatever we've seen and heard of him, he seems firmly grounded.

4168___10.24am: National anthems time.

4168___Pranay: "Most uncompetitive? Not by a long shot. Except AFG and may be SL, all teams are afraid of losing to any of the others. Count out WI at your own peril despite their waywardness and BAN have been fantastic. PAK is of course PAK. Real disappointment has been SA. As other biggies haven't really met each other, SA's matches were to provide the oomph in the 1st half but sadly that wasn't to be. "

4168___10.27am: All in readiness to start. Pleasant crowd build-up too. Karunaratne and Kusal Perera striding out to open for Sri Lanka. Woakes has the ball, two slips. Over the wicket.

4168___Woakes to Karunaratne, no run, cut him in half first ball!. On a length, nipping back in and hits his thigh pad on the way to the keeper.

4168___Archer to MDKJ Perera, no run, lovely line first up, kissing the fourth stump. Confident leave by the batsman, but ends up being a good one because the ball is moving gently away

4168___Archer to Karunaratne, OUT, got him! It's that lovely, lovely line that does it. Archer has taken out the Sri Lankan captain with one that is moving away but bowled in the channel. Karunaratne follows it with his hands, it's bowled at the perfect line that just draws the bat slightly away from the body, kisses it's edge and goes to the keeper.

4168___Woakes to MDKJ Perera, OUT, slashed straight down to third man! Two in two and Sri Lanka are tottering already. Reminded of Jayasuriya's dismissal against Srinath that sent an entire nation into tizzy - albeit temporarily - during the 1996 World Cup semi-final in Kolkata. This was short, had enough width, he threw his bat at it to get a thick outside edge, this was in the air for a while, Moeen picked it early, took a few steps in, settled underneath and pouched it quite nicely.

4168___Woakes to Fernando, 2 runs, nice looking punch off the back foot and a mis-field gives them two. Risky second though. Punched to mid-on, who fumbles. They make the second run but he has to dive to get in at the end

4168___5.4

4168___Archer to Fernando, SIX runs, shot!. Archer's overdone the short ball, gets his radar quite wrong that time, chest high on leg stump, and he swivels and uncorks a beauty of a pull shot that sends the ball rocketing over fine leg

4168___6

4168___5.5

4168___Archer to Fernando, FOUR runs, beautiful. Archer overcompensates by bowling it very full outside off, and he leans into a creamy drive that sends the ball purring to the cover fence

4168___Very impressive by Fernando, who is showing that his inclusion in the XI was well worth it. His shot-making has been a treat, and he's not cowed down by the early wickets, the pace, or the reputation of England's bowlers.

4168___Pashin Goyal : "Wasn't there a Sri Lankan bowler in the past also called Fernando. Are they related?" - they're not. Just like Rohit Sharma and Ishant Sharma aren't related!

4168___Woakes to Fernando, FOUR runs, and now he biffs that disdainfully to the square leg boundary! On the shorter side, he picked up the length very early and rocked back to swat it away

4168___4

4168___Archer to Fernando, SIX runs, clobbered. He was expecting the bouncer in response, and Archer did just that. Fernando was waiting, rocked back, swivelled and pulled it from in front of his face and into the fine leg crowd. In fact that's been pulled so far into the crowd they need a new ball! Bounced on a railing and went out of the ground I think

4168___Wood to Fernando, OUT, he's upper cut it straight down third man's throat! What have you done Avishka, you were looking so in control... Short ball outside off, and for some reason he thought it would be a good idea to just gently upper-cut it, help it along its way as it were - except Adil Rashid was stationed at third man, so it was always a shot with high risk. And he's duly gobbled up, taking a few steps forward

4168___Saoirse: "I love all 3 formats, especially Tests, but there's a very strong argument for ODIs being the best. It's not mindless slogging like T20s can be, yet it still has monstrous innings (see Morgan, or some late order cameos) whilst giving a more even competition between bat and ball. And on the other side it's far more accessible and shorter than Tests, and you always get a result. A perfect balance - never trust anyone who wants to discard of 50 over cricket!" If I look back on some of the things I was writing about ODIs in 2004 ... I can't believe I agree with this point of view!

4168___Bimal: "Poor from Mathews. A strike rate of 50% by the most experienced player only puts back pressure on the other end. " - do remember though, that he was score-less for his first 12 balls. His strike since his first run is about par for the situation Sri Lanka are in.

4168___Archer to de Silva, OUT, Root leaps to his left at mid-on and pulls off a super catch. Slower ball, leg-cutter at just 111 kph, pitched on off and moving away. Another mis-timed pull, it was only a matter of time before one of those went to a fielder. This one almost didn't, came off the toe-end and travelled to mid-on, where Root ran to his left and leapt up to pluck the ball.

4168___The wicket has pushed Forecaster up from 238 to 244 - because it's Thisara Perera out to bat, and he is expected to score quicker than Dhananjaya

4168___S. M. ZUNAIR : "What is good total score here at leeds for sri lanka to win?? " - I would have said at least 300-plus but don't think Sri Lanka can reach there. They just need to get as many as they can and put up a fight in the field and with the ball.

4168___Wood to Mathews, 2 runs, short ball on the stumps, pulled to deep midwicket. Placed well enough to run two.

4168___2

4168___Wood to NLTC Perera, no run, quicker one to Thisara, 144kph and well wide of off stump, another wide yorker. Thisara does his stand and deliver routine but he'll need to move his feet to get near that - and he doesn't

4168___Atit: "Early morning in US. Not happy to see 6 down but very happy to see Matthews is back. Hoping for 240-250 to give something to SL bowlers. Anything can happen in Cricket right?" - yeah it can. But Mathews is not exactly 'back'. This has been a fairly turgid innings.

4168___Archer to Mathews, 1 run, he's still trying to give himself room but Archer follows him with a length ball and he can only steer it away to point

4168___1

4168___45.1

4168___Archer to NLTC Perera, OUT, caught by Rashid diving forward at third man. The short ball works for Jofra, gets it to rise above shoulder height outside off, and Thisara has a slash at it, but without control. The ball flies off a top edge to third man, where Rashid takes a good catch.

4168___W

4168___45.4

4168___Forecaster still says 231. I say Sri Lanka aren't likely to get that many either.

4168___Archer to Mathews, 1 run, full ball outside off, steps away and drives again. But it's like Mathews and timing have had a temporary divorce in this innings. The ball goes to mid-off

4168___With that wicket, Archer has pulled up alongside Starc on 15 wickets - joint highest in the World Cup so far

4168___Wood to Udana, 1 run, yorker on the stumps, but he's backing away so is able to square drive it to deep point

4168___1

4168___46.1

4168___Wood to Mathews, 1 leg bye, backing away again, but Wood follows with one of his cutters. The batsman doesn't get room or pace and can only tap the ball towards mid-on

4168___1lb

4168___46.2

4168___Wood to Udana, FOUR runs, much-needed boundary, though not where he was aiming at. Short ball outside off, Udana has a big swing at it, it flies off the bat face over point - he was targetting over midwicket

4168___4

4168___46.3

4168___I Udana c Root b Wood 6 (7m 4b 1x4 0x6) SR: 150.00

4168___Wood to Udana, OUT, backing away again, Wood does his shtick where he follows the batsman. Bowls it back of a length, no room for Udana to pull, but he goes for it anyway. Gets it high on the bat, and it loops up. Root at mid-on takes a few steps back and settles under it.

4168___Suresh varanasi: "Very disappointed with performances of SL and SA.. Losing is one thing, but losing in such comprehensive manner is making me, as a cricket fan, very sad "

4168___Wood to Mathews, FOUR runs, high full toss, think that was very close to a no-ball. 148kph too! But a good shot by Mathews at long last, stays legside of the ball, opens the face and sends this to the point fence

4168___0

4168___48.1

4168___Wood to Malinga, no run, another short ball, following Malinga who was backing away. Half-appeal from Wood, but the ball seemed to have gone off the batsman's shoulder and to the keeper. Yep replays confirm its off the shoulder

4168___SL Malinga b Wood 1 (9m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20.00

4168___Wood to Malinga, OUT, the old two-card trick works. Quick bouncer followed by inch-perfect yorker. Hits the base of leg stump - Malinga's exposing all his stumps backing away - quicker than Malinga can bring his bat down for his attempted slash through the off side.

4168___W

4168___48.3

4168___Amey Gupte : "This World Cup was set up with a very good format to be most competitive. Alas, the gap between top 4 and others (mentally and skills wise) is just too wide! The top have been table toppers since week 2 and that doesn't seem like will change - SAD."

4168___Wood to Pradeep, 1 run, backing away and Wood follows him with an attempted yorker. Turns into a low full toss, that he manages to swat to mid-on to get off strike. It's what Malinga, with all his experience, should have attempted to do last ball instead of going for a glory shot.

4168___1

4168___48.4

4168___Wood to Mathews, 2 runs, slower yorker follows Mathews who was backing away and he can only dig it out to mid-on. But they are alive to the possibility of two runs and they get it, with no England fielders nearby.

4168___Archer to Mathews, SIX runs, nails the big swing over cow corner. That's a well-timed one - a rarity in this innings by Mathews. Full on the pads, and swung lustily

4168___0

4168___49.3

4168___Jibran: "Looking at the performances of different teams. The WC is essentially a 4 teams tournament!! The real WC will start with 1st Semi Final. " Sad but true. Though I do feel sorry for Bangladesh ... two seriously impressive wins against South Africa and West Indies, two hard-fought losses against Australia and New Zealand. Had it not been for a wash-out against Sri Lanka, they might well be in the mix still. They aren't completely out of it, of course, but they'll need to beat India to have a chance.

4168___2.15pm Hello again, so, 233 is the target. It's hard to see an upset, isn't it? But you never know... that's the beauty of cricket!

4168___2.20pm Andy J: "Regardless of the result in this game, this is the 5th time in 6 games that the England bowlers have held the opposition to less than 300. All the talk before the tournament was about the England batting, but I think other teams will see that they aren't the one trick ponies people were saying before the tournament." I agree. Archer has added a new cutting edge, but so too has a fit Mark Wood. If Rashid can get the rip back in his action, England are well placed in the bowling front.

4168___Parthee: "It's interesting to hear from David Willey who was not happy after his exclusion in the world cup squad and his current thought of England's performance so far in this world cup" I'm sure, deep down, he'd recognise that the selectors may the right call. He's got a busy County Championship programme to keep him occupied.

4168___2.23pm Vivek: "Heh, this world cup is reminding me of umpteen men's tennis grand slams from the past 15 years, where the only thing I'd do during the first week and a half was wait for the Fed/Rafa/Djoker/?? semifinals to arrive. " And Murray, don't forget Murray ... the New Zealand of the big four.

4168___2.26pm Here come the England openers. Jonny Bairstow, fresh from a feisty 90 v Afghanistan, and James Vince, who probably could do with a decent knock today, just to reassure himself and his team that he's an adequate stand-in for Jason Roy... the extent of whose hamstring injury remains a bit of a mystery... Lasith Malinga has the new ball. Play!

4168___Malinga to Vince, 1 run, very full, slung into the legs, and clipped behind square to get the innings up and running

He's reviewing, but I strongly doubt this will change anything. Clipping surely ... indeed it is! Yorkshire's JB has fallen in front of his home crowd!

I would like to see what will happen in a few years time when players start to figure him out " I suspect the main reason is that he clocks 90mph+ without breaking sweat. But yes, I suspect his newbie status has played some part. Be interesting to see what happens against India... he's no stranger to the IPL.

4168___Pradeep to Vince, 1 run, pushed firmly off the back foot, cover makes a meal of the interception and they jog an easy single

They are the only team in this world cup who never got all the 10 wickets of teams like SL, AFG.

4168___Now then, Stokes on strike, this will be tasty...

4168___Udana to Stokes, SIX runs, length ball, angled into Stokes' arc and utterly lambasted over long-on! Tremendous muscular batting, but that is not smart bowling

4168___6

4168___45.1

4168___Udana to Stokes, SIX runs, Stokes on the rampage! A gallop down the track, a mighty heave over wide long-off! Pace on the ball, and it vanishes!

4168___45.2

4168___Udana to Stokes, no run, Stokes leaves his crease again, but picks the slower ball this time, and checks his stroke with a punch to cover

4168___0

4168___45.3

4168___Udana to Stokes, 2 runs, tapped into the leg side, and Stokes wants two immediately! Wood slips momentarily, but finds his feet to scamper home!

4168___Phew... this is lively. Unexpectedly lively, dare I say it! Nuwan Pradeep returns after a stunning first spell... if he can replicate those figures Sri Lanka are in business...

4168___0

4168___46.1

4168___Pradeep to Stokes, FOUR runs, hauled across the line, brilliantly! A bottom-handed shovel from so deep in the crease.... Malinga gallops but can't intercept at long-on!

4168___4

4168___46.2

4168___Pradeep to Stokes, FOUR runs, completely loses his shape on the pull but gets it away! A miscued pull through backward square, and there's no-one to cut that off!

4168___4

4168___46.3

4168___A huge conflab now as Sri Lanka realise ... this is their World Cup, here and now...

4168___Pradeep to Stokes, no run, full toss, outside off, looking for two as the sweeper swoops, but they decide none is a better bet

4168___0

4168___46.4

4168___Pradeep to Stokes, 1 run, on the toes, clipped to the leg side, this time they run, and Wood once again has a solitary ball to survive...

4168___46.5

4168___Peter: "Amazing difference once the talismanic bowler has finished his overs. Now if our talismanic all rounder can keep going..."

4168___Pradeep to Wood, OUT, edged and it's all over! That was the perfect ball to the No. 11... full, fast, in the corridor of uncertainty... and feathered to the keeper!
