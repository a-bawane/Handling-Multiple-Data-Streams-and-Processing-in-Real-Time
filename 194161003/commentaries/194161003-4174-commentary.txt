4174___9:32am Good morning! Welcome to today's coverage of the 1992 World Cup. New Zealand are on the brink of following Australia into the semi-finals, while Pakistan are far from any such comfort. Six points separating these two teams at the moment, a fair reflection of how different their campaigns have been so far.

4174___Tabrez: "I am worried about Sarfraz's tendeny to choose to bowl (if he wins the toos) by looking at the weather conditions, this will be half match lost if he does that. Learn from this tournament's history and make a wise decision to bat first"

4174___Hasnain: "Come on Pakistan. Beat the logics. It's your time to prove the world wrong and somehow manage to reach last four!"

4174___ZEESHAN AHMED: "In 1992, New Zealand was the unbeaten side like this world cup until their group match with Pakistan who defeated them. Hoping for the trend to continue. Go Green Go"

4174___9:37am It looks like we're going to have a battle with rain today. None at the moment, but there have been drizzles this morning. First battle is to start on time and it could go either way at the moment from what I hear.

4174___Sidharth Monga reports from the ground: "The mizzle is still in the air. You can see it on the glasses or if you leave your mobile outside. Not enough to stop play but not sure if you can start in it. There's hardly any breeze to blow it away."

4174___9:46am Right, there will be a delayed start. There will be an inspection at 10.30. Although the covers are coming off.

4174___Salman: "in 1992 there was no rain in #PakvsNZ match. God save us from this dissimilarity :("

4174___Asif Khan: "I dont' get it, my weather app says 0% chance of rain all day?" --- Yours and many others! And lets hope it stays that way after this initial nuisance.

4174___James : "If the inspection gives the green light can we start in time to avoMohammad Haque: "I am just 2 miles from the ground. There was some drizzle this morning but is dry now and expected to be dry whole day.

4174___Tabrez: "@Zeeshan check out the espncricinfo article on the similarities for Pak in 1992 and 2019. Its "MIND BOGGLING"" --- Yes. Here it is: The eerie similarities between 1992 and 2019 for Pakistan

4174___Shabaz: "Credit to SriLanka for their upset win over England because without that it would have been very straight forward. That victory brought the much needed spice to the tournament in regards with the semi's contention scenario."

4174___Dr iftikhar: "According to Ricky Ponting: Pakistan team can beat you the day they want to beat you. I hope its that day they are serious and not casual about fielding specially."

4174___Aftab: "I think Pakistan should never go for chase even though conditions are favoring 2nd batting. Once Newzealand puts a good total. They are gonna panick"

4174___Shamweel Qamar: "i am anxiously ready to leave my office here in South Korea for the match. Let's hope the players leave the boring dressing room to play on the field " --- Reckon you can get to Birmingham before the inspection?

4174___Julian McKinnon: "I remember '92 - it was when I first fell in love with cricket. That semi-final was devastating. I'd love to see NZ put that ghost to bed today."

4174___Rizwan: "How intresting, people are so enthusiastic about the 1992-2019 similarities, but do not want to bowl first, at any cost :) "

4174___Ahmed: "Hypothetically, if it is a washout today? what will be impact for pakistan chances? " --- Won't be as big an impact as if they lose. They can still get to 10 points with a washout today.

4174___10:05 am Right, what is the most ideal scenario at the toss according to you? Shashank's got a poll running on the Live Report, so get in and vote!

4174___AGNEL PEREIRA: "I never realised UK Weather forecasts are as sloppy as Bangalore's! And the guy who heads the Met here is one Mr S.Gavaskar (no relation to the super cricketer turned commentator, I presume)." --- No! Heads the Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre, I think.

4174___Saatybu: "This is probably New Zealand's last chance to experiment a bit with the lineup a bit. Despite the team winning - I'd still like to see Nicholls, Blundell and Southee come in for Munro, Latham and Henry respectively. They are quality players and deserve a spell."

4174___ROBERT MILLER: "If the match is a washout will NZ have qualified for the semifinals?" --- Almost certainly, says Rajesh from the stats team. "SL could also get up to 12 with 5 wins, then they could be fighting for one spot. NZ have a good NRR, but if they lose two and SL win three, it could be different."

4174___What made Waqar Younis cringe when these two sides last met at the World Cup? Shashank tells us on the #LiveReport

4174___10:28am Two minutes to the inspection. The teams are warming up. Good signs.

4174___Time to welcome Danyal Rasool into commentary. See you in a bit!

4174___There's a pitch on the square that is wet. It has been covered with an astroturf-like carpet, says Monga from the ground.

4174___Hello, everyone! So I'm here to take you through to the start of the game. At least this way, no one can accuse me of jinxing anything. Except, of course, if it begins to rain again, in which case I am patently guilty.

4174___Dhina: "Quick q. Why does it take so long between pitch inspection and toss? Couldn't the umpires simply signal for the captains to join them for the toss once they deem the conditions acceptable? Seems a bit of wasted time, no? " This is me having a punt, but I'd say once it's established the toss can go ahead, the preparation to clear the ground of everyone and everyone not directly to do with the game begins. It probably shouldn't take half an hour, but cricket doesn't like to be rushed.

4174___.

4174___Shernawaz: "With What margin should pakistan win to make its runrate into positive?" Too much. I'd say they aren't thinking along those lines. Besides, it doesn't matter. Pakistan and England will likely end up on a different number of points barring a tie or washout, while Pakistan and Bangladesh are unlikely to, given they still have to face each other.

4174___sana: "my comment is not been posted even for a single time though I've been writing for ESPNcricinfo for almost 3 years. Bowling first in this situation is perfect thing to do after winning toss. But I dont think pakistan bowling is so up to the mark to bowl first and restrict NZ under 250"

4174___Sid Monga says New Zealand appear unchanged, though this isn't conformed yet, obviously. That, crucially, means Colin Munro and Matt Henry, the two who were most in danger of missing out, look set to play

4174___10:34am Toss at 11am. Start at 11.30am. No overs lost.

4174___They are unchanged for the fifth game in a row. "You turn up and know you'll have a tough game, as Pakistan are a very tough side. For us, it's trying to build on those performances and keep improving," Williamson says. He says he expects the Kiwi fans to be vastly outweighed by Pakistan supporters, but he doesn't mind.

4174___Pakistan, too, are unchanged.

4174___Sarfaraz says he wanted to bat first too. They aren't worrying about the conditions and wanted to set a target. "Good to see Amir back in form, as well as Wahab Riaz," he says. "The fielding is a concern but we're working hard and hopefully we'll do well as a fielding unit today."

4174___Doesn't seem a good time to remind Pakistan fans only once this tournament has a total above 250 been chased, and that came in the game between West Indies and Bangladesh.

4174___New Zealand: 1 Colin Munro, 2 Martin Guptill, 3 Kane Williamson (c), 4 Ross Taylor, 5 Tom Latham (wk), 6 Colin de Grandhomme, 7 Jimmy Neesham, 8 Mitchell Santner, 9 Matt Henry, 10 Lockie Ferguson, 11 Trent Boult

4174___Pakistan: 1 Imam-ul-Haq, 2 Fakhar Zaman, 3 Babar Azam, 4 Mohammad Hafeez, 5 Haris Sohail, 6 Sarfaraz Ahmed (c), 7 Imad Wasim, 8 Shadab Khan, 9 Mohammad Amir, 10 Wahab Riaz, 11 Shaheen Afridi

4174___Here are how the teams shape up

4174___Abuzar Amin: "The only thing Pakistan should think of now, early wickets , early wickets, early wickets .... "

4174___Haseeb: "@DR, NZ can be restricted under 250. Pakistani fans are not worrying about it"

4174___Adam S: "Nice to see Grandhomme taking over wicketkeeping duties from Latham. ;)" You chaps just don't miss anything, do you? That was up for the best part of 30 seconds, but hasn't stopped me hearing about it!

4174___aqeel: "Comments frequency has dropped as we close in on the contest? Come on everyone! I come here to read interesting comments." Post a good one yourself, then! :)

4174___New Zealand has won the toss and will bat first

4174___Shakir: "I want to say Pakistan zindabad, can it be published " Why not?

4174___We're closing in on the action now. Anthems are just moments away, and following that, we should have live action for you. To recap, Pakistan need to win to have a realistic chance of qualifying, while New Zealand, most likely already through, will mathematically guarantee it with two points today.

4174___And the anthems are about to start. For the first ten overs, here's Varun. Be good to him!

4174___11:28am Hello again! The anthems are done, with both captains flashing big smiles at the end of their respective anthems. A wholesome, G-rated start on a gloomy day. A match at last. Here we go. Guptil and Munro in the middle. Hafeez will start, to try and trouble Munro, no doubt.

4174___Mohammad Hafeez to Guptill, FOUR runs, swept to the long leg boundary. Goodbye gloom! Guptill's feet move nicely. Plants a big stride and sweeps this full ball from middle

4174___Mohammad Amir to Guptill, OUT, pandemonium! Amir has delivered first ball and the crowd has erupted. Full ball pushed across off stump. Guptill has played it onto his stumps. Did he expect it to swing back in? It didn't and by the end of this sequence, his hands are so far away from the body as he tries to drive through the off side. Amir wheels away into the leg side. What a start

4174___W

4174___1.1

4174___Mohammad Amir to Williamson, no run, beats the outside edge. Oooooh boy this is tense. Length on middle and off. Looks to defend close to the body but is caught inside the line by the angle

4174___0

4174___1.3

4174___Mohammad Amir to Williamson, 1 run, drops it into the covers with soft hands. Calm as. Length ball at off and he waits so long before getting bat on this

4174___Mohammad Amir to Munro, 2 runs, chipped over midwicket and once again with little control. Munro's feet yet to wake up this innings. But this length ball on the pads wasn't going to trouble him at all

4174___2

4174___3.1

4174___Akshat: "There is just different kind of energy in and around the ground. I wonder how good the Pakistan team will be if they play all matches like a knockout !!!"

4174___Mohammad Amir to Munro, FOUR runs, nicely timed. That's where he wants it - some room outside off, about thigh height. Stands tall and punches through the covers

4174___4

4174___3.2

4174___Mohammad Amir to Munro, FOUR runs, slapped away! The counterpunch from Munro. That'll ease the nerves. It has certainly cut the noise. Three average deliveries from Amir. This is short of a length and even wider than the last one. Point has no chance

4174___4.3

4174___Shaheen Shah Afridi to Williamson, FOUR runs, caressed to the square leg boundary. A genius at work. Length on the pads, but stopping and climbing up on him a touch. But he adjusts after stretching out and gets the timing just right to keep both square leg and fine leg interested, before beating them both

Shaheen with that discipline again. Gets it a length in the corridor, gets the extra lift and Taylor's nervous forward prod has picked up an edge that flies towards first slip. Pakistan's captain doesn't let it get that far

4174___Shaheen Shah Afridi to Latham, no run, Latham isn't interested in playing at anything not threatening his stumps at the moment. Happy to let this one go by, too

4174___Shaheen Shah Afridi to Latham, OUT, gone, this is much too good for Latham. Shaheen's on fire. Pitched on a length just outside off stump, and shapes away ever so slightly, taking the outside edge of Latham's bat as he attempts yet another defensive stroke. Never quite looked like getting a move on, and now New Zealand are four down. It might really be on!

4174___Muhammad Tahir: "I Know Kane's wicket is the key, but if Pak can keep getting wickets at the other end it would put pressure on him and make mistakes."

4174___I promise, no one's ever going to trust process if Pakistan get through at England's expense. One team's done everything right for four years, while the other has looked nowhere near that level for at least the past two. And the latter's threatens to pip the former to the last four. Amazing drama.

4174___Jimmy Neesham's in.

4174___Shaheen Shah Afridi to Neesham, no run, nearly nicked that one, too. Shaheen is unplayable at the moment. Pitched at that same nagging line once more, and whooshes past the outside edge

4174___Shadab Khan to Williamson, OUT, has he got him? He's got him! Shadab Khan has done it! Length ball, dipping outside off and drawing Williamson forward. he stabs at it away from the body as it turns and gets big off the surface. A faint edge on it and keeper holds on. Lovely bowling but also uncharacteristically loose from Williamson, who was getting a bit weary outside off in the last 15-20 minutes. Still, it takes some doing to get him out there and Shadab has produced the perfect delivery. Just a lovely pace on that

4174___Shaheen Shah Afridi to Neesham, no run, yorker just outside off, looks to carve this through off side and is beaten on the inside edge. Pakistan have the faint idea that there's an edge on that. They don't review. But the umpires now have a discussion and they've sent it up...so they think he's got an edge. Soft signal is not out. Sarfraz took this quite low. 'Can't use Ultra Edge,' says the third umpire presumably because the bat is jamming into the turf as the ball passes it. So it will remain not out, without even going to the zoomer on whether that carried. Hang on. Now they're checking again... this one is possibly Pakistan's review. Not clear yet. But it does remain not out. Funnily, this time Ultra Edge IS used. Don't let anyone tell you they understand cricket in its entirety...

4174___Umair: "Hard to believe.. Amir has been the most expensive today! "

4174___Wahab Riaz to Neesham, no run, full inswinger at middle stump, jammed back to the bowler

4174___0

4174___49.3

4174___Wahab Riaz to Neesham, 2 runs, this is superb bowling. Followed by atrocious backing up by Wahab to give them an extra run. Inswinging yorker outside off, can do no more than slice it to sweeper cover. His throw comes in on the bounce and Wahab barely flaps out at it. Overthrows at midwicket

4174___2

4174___49.4

4174___Wahab Riaz to Neesham, 1 wide, just wide. Full and wide outside off. He was backing into the leg side to make room and couldn't attempt a shot. It was just wide of the marker though

4174___1w

4174___49.5

4174___Wahab Riaz to Neesham, 2 runs, mistimed slug over mid-off. Plonks into the turf and rolls out weakly as long-on comes around. Length ball from Wahab but once again he escapes because of the late movement in

4174___2

4174___49.5

4174___Wahab Riaz to Neesham, SIX runs, finally nails one! Wahab goes slower ball for some reason, and short. Sits up nicely for Neesham and he slaps from underneath to clear the midwicket boundary

4174___49.6

4174___3:20pm 'Once you realise you'll survive without the game, you'll enjoy it for what it is' - Jimmy Neesham's words talking about how he'd almost retired, partly because of missing out on the last World Cup. He found perspective, he found balance, and he finds himself at the end of a New Zealand innings that looked like it could have ended an hour ago. This is a top effort from him. Just a few short of a century, but he has kept New Zealand in the game along with Colin de Grandhomme. Kane Williamson was at it, doing the rescue briefly, but Pakistan had him early enough to cause some serious trouble. An epic show from them the first 30 overs, particularly from the two youngest bowlers in their line-up. They had New Zealand panicking. But we have some sort of parity now. 237 is by no means a scary total, and Mickey Arthur has just said he backs his batsmen to get it. But it is enough for New Zealand to come out more confident. I get the feeling we're in for a sensational game today.

4174___Meanwhile, there was delight for Bangladesh and despair for India in football today, as Dhaka Abahani reached the AFC Cup knockout stage at the cost of Chennaiyin FC in thrilling fashion. Debayan Sen, switching his attention to football today, describes how the drama unfolded.

4174___SabbirChowdhury: "Neesham has missed his first ODI hundred by just three runs. And in the last over he scored 12 runs! All my sympathies!"

4174___imran: "50 runs of last 5 overs. pakistan need 238 to win. 85 runs in last 10 overs. once NZ were 83/5 n they managed to end as 237/6 6th wicket going down at 217. impressive comeback by NZ all rounders. neesham stayed not out 97. good luck pakistan"

4174___Ahsan: "It's not that hard to bat on i think pak will win in 43rd over inshallah "

4174___Jatin Goyal: "Irrespective of the result of today's game, NZ look a great team - 2 explosive openers, very stable 3 & 4, one wicket keeper batsman, 2 gritty allrounders, 4 good bowlers - perfectly balanced team on paper All they need is a belief that they can win the cup"

4174___Himash: "Jimmy Neesham did an Angelo Matthews today. Read the wicked and grinded it out to bring NZ to parity. Will be the decider. "

4174___Arif Hossain: "I have a feeling that Jimmy Neesham innings is going to be the decider tonight! "

4174___Umer : "After getting Williamson, bringing back Imad waseem allowed De Grandhome and Neesham to set. Sarfraz needed to be more aggressive at that time."

4174___Lakshman Kumar: "With Boult and Ferguson's good form, I feel NZ are 10-15 runs above par from the start they got..!"

4174___Anjan: "NZ not getting bowled out despite a big scare gives a soft signal of confidence to Pak fans about non existence of a monster in the pitch. Just a pressure handling game from now on I reckon "

4174___Syed: "NZ final score is more due to good sensible batting by 6th wkt partnership rather than poor bowling and poor fielding by Pakistan. Got to give credit where it is due...."

4174___Burhan: "Well, I guess this is Good effort from NZ but at the toss Pakistan would happily get 237 at the end of First Innings :), Best of Luck Pakistan "

4174___##########

4174___Kumar Suresh: "My friend here in Auckland who plays for a local club says, "we play on these sort of wickets day-in-day-out during the end of our season. I see no reason why we wont win this." he reminds me of 2011 wc against SA. Defending low totals is in the genes of NZ. They thrive on it"

4174___The players have started to make their way onto the field, with the start about five minutes away.

4174___Welcome back. Danyal here, and I'll take you through the first ten overs as Fakhar Zaman and Imam-ul-Haq look to take Pakistan through that same period without too much drama. The bowlers have - largely - done their job, and Pakistan will be bitterly disappointed if they come up short here.

4174___Boult to Imam-ul-Haq, no run, good start. Movement in the air, pitched up, and only an inside edge saves a certain lbw

4174___0

4174___0.1

4174___Boult to Imam-ul-Haq, no run, length delivery this time, and Imam turns it away to the onside

4174___0

4174___0.2

4174___Boult to Imam-ul-Haq, no run, fuller. Boult wants to give this new ball achance to swing. Imam gets on the front foot nice and early this time, and makes good contact

4174___0

4174___0.3

4174___Boult to Imam-ul-Haq, no run, short delivery, and that was nearly a run out! Imam ran it down to third man, but Guptill dived in the slips to prevent it going there, and nearly caught Imam napping

4174___0

4174___0.4

4174___Boult to Imam-ul-Haq, no run, crisply timed to point. This is a good start by both batsman and bowler

4174___0

4174___0.5

4174___Boult to Imam-ul-Haq, FOUR runs, brilliant shot. Picked up the short length early, and swivelled to the onside, dispatching the ball to the square leg boundary, First runs for Pakistan, they're off and running

4174___Matt Henry to operate from the other end

4174___Abhinav Mishra: "With so many teams having odd points due to washout games - I recon there will not be a NRR fight for number 4 spot in the points table. Teams will have different points."

4174___Henry to Fakhar Zaman, no run, full and wide. Not quite timed, but straight back to the bowler

4174___0

4174___1.1

4174___Henry to Fakhar Zaman, FOUR runs, loose delivery. Full and wide, and Henry just doesn't have the pace to get away with it. Fakhar caresses it through extra cover, and it races to the boundary

4174___4

4174___1.2

4174___Henry to Fakhar Zaman, no run, tighter to the stumps, and Fakhar can't get this one away

4174___0

4174___Relive the 132-run partnership between James Neesham and Colin de Grandhomme in our highlights reel (Australia, UK, SE Asia only)

4174___Henry to Imam-ul-Haq, FOUR runs, glorious batting. Pitched up to Imam, whose eyes light up at that length. Leans into that straight drive, and there's no stopping that speeding away

4174___4

4174___1.5

4174___Henry to Imam-ul-Haq, 2 runs, worked away to square leg. Good running; the pair come back for two. Excellent start by Pakistan

4174___Will Gill: "Everyone is thinking about NRR fo 4th spot, but the first tie-breaker is number of wins and right now England hold the advantage (they also have a far superior NRR anyway). I don't see the Poms missing the semis." Unless Pakistan or Bangladesh have a washout, neither number of wins or NRR should come into it. England just need to win 2 games. It's in their hands.

4174___Boult to Fakhar Zaman, FOUR runs, width from Boult, and Fakhar hasn't any patience for that line. Crunched through cover, and the ball smashes into the fence before the offside field even turn around to admire it

4174___4

4174___2.1

4174___Boult to Fakhar Zaman, no run, little risky from Fakhar. Turned his wrists against the swing and it nearly carried to Colin Munro at short midwicket. Boult won't mind seeing that

4174___0

4174___2.2

4174___Boult to Fakhar Zaman, no run, lovely delivery. Movement in the air but the ball held its line in the end, slicing Fakhar in half and barely missing off stump

4174___Boult to Fakhar Zaman, no run, driven right back to the bowler

4174___0

4174___2.4

4174___Boult to Fakhar Zaman, no run, good line and length. Pitched on middle stump and threatening off, but Fakhar keeps it out with the outer part of his bat. Good comeback from the bowler after the first ball

4174___2.5

4174___Fakhar Zaman c Guptill b Boult 9 (13m 10b 2x4 0x6) SR: 90.00

4174___Boult to Fakhar Zaman, OUT, and caps the over with a wicket! Wasn't the best delivery, in truth. Dragged it down to the legside and didn't get the swing he was hoping. But Fakhar, who wanted to loft it over midwicket, found the leading edge and saw, with horror, the ball going to point instead, where Guptill's bucket-like hands sent him on his way

4174___0

4174___3.2

4174___Henry to Imam-ul-Haq, no run, Henry's keeping it simple. Stump to stump line. He hasn't found the swing that Boult has, so this is clever bowling

4174___0

4174___3.3

4174___Henry to Imam-ul-Haq, 1 run, driven to mid-off and the pair steal a single. Good running. First look at Babar now

4174___Right guys, let's just stop focusing on net run rate and qualification scenarios and talk about this match. It's absorbing enough without those distractions

4174___Boult to Imam-ul-Haq, no run, shaping away. Imam gets onto the front foot and drives to extra cover

4174___0

4174___4.1

4174___Boult to Imam-ul-Haq, FOUR runs, probing delivery, gets the outside edge. NZ don't have second slip, and Boult watches in agony as that one runs down to third man for four. NZ must attack, especially with Boult moving it about

4174___4

4174___4.2

4174___Boult to Imam-ul-Haq, no run, straighter on this occasion, and Imam blocks stoutly

4174___0

4174___4.3

4174___Boult to Imam-ul-Haq, no run, short ball, where has that gone? Turns out it hit Imam and snuggled into his pad. Imam asks the fielders if it's okay to take it out with his hand. NZ aren't going to appeal, of course, so no harm done

4174___0

4174___4.4

4174___Boult to Imam-ul-Haq, no run, short and fast. Pushes Imam back who fends it away to the leg side

4174___Henry to Babar Azam, no run, driven through the offside, but can't beat the man stationed at mid-off

4174___0

4174___5.1

4174___Henry to Babar Azam, no run, gets on the back foot and punches it through the offside. After a loose first over, Henry is supporting Boult really well

4174___0

4174___5.2

4174___Henry to Babar Azam, 2 runs, and NZ might just have had another wicket! Short delivery, and Babar ran out of patience, skying an attempted pull. Colin de Grandhomme raced back and was just a yard away from completing a remarkable catch

4174___2

4174___5.3

4174___Henry to Babar Azam, 3 runs, better shot. This is what he should do. Slices this through the offside field, and gets himself off strike with three

4174___5.4

4174___Henry to Imam-ul-Haq, 1 run, punched down the ground and Pakistan scamper through for a quick single

4174___1

4174___Chan: "Matt Henry took a real pasting last match. I wonder if it has dented his confidence. Doesn't seem effective in the middle." He's bowled within himself, I'd say. He doesn't quite have the weapons Boult does, and he understands that. I wouldn't be too dismissive

4174___Boult to Imam-ul-Haq, 2 runs, shaping away, but Imam steps into the off-drive and just about splits the cover fielders. good cricket from the left-hander.

4174___Boult to Babar Azam, no run, absolute jaffa, that one. Babar closed the face of the bat but the ball moved at the last moment. Just missed the off stump, the outside edge, as well as the pad. Boult gets one over Babar

4174___0

4174___8.1

4174___8.3

4174___Boult to Babar Azam, no run, wisely, Babar shoulders arms. Boult is a threat Babar wants to negate as much as possible. No point fighting fire with fire just yet

4174___8.4

4174___Boult to Babar Azam, FOUR runs, excellent shot. Boult came around the wicket to angle it in, but this was much too straight for Babra to miss out. Leans into the classical drive, and Boult lets out a cry of anguish

4174___Ferguson to Imam-ul-Haq, OUT, Guptill you absolute monster! Big strides forward, big limbs reaching out, but the grace of a much smaller man as he dives and gets his fingers under this at point! And this following an absolute scorcher of a bouncer from Lockie, jumping up at Imam's grille from middle stump. Remember, he'd caused him problems in the UAE, even hit him on the head not so long ago. Goes straight for the bouncer option. Imam just fends at it with no clue and it pings off the shoulder of the bat. Just brutal fast bowling

4174___W

4174___10.2

4174___Ferguson to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, Hafeez nearly runs himself out of the contest! Geez. Pakistan's most experienced batsman, looked like a newbiew there. Length and in at off stump. His feet are rooted and he pokes at this nervously. It rolls into the leg side weakly and he's just taken off without a call. Neesham can't hit direct

4174___0

4174___10.3

4174___Ferguson to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, onto his glove. Short bal lrising into the corridor. Hangs the bat out and hopes. It's into his body. And then a sheepish grin

4174___Ferguson to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, beats the inside edge. Short of a length and angled in. He cuts from over it

4174___10.5

4174___Ferguson to Mohammad Hafeez, 1 run, inside edge again as he takes the bottom hand off and hangs the bat out to protect his mid-riff. This short ball gives him no room. It flies down to fine leg

4174___1

4174___10.6

4174___Whew. That was fire.

4174___0

4174___11.4

4174___Henry to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, aerial but not enough on this to carry to the bowler. Full and driving length, but he gets tangled by his own forward stride and ends up hitting more of his pad than the ball

4174___A slip in place. Also a backward short leg. Hafeez having a word with the umpire about sight screen problems. A game of microseconds against Lockie, who has both the pace and that 'stache vying for your attention...looks like there's some sort of a concrete patch that isn't fully covered.

4174___Ferguson to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, past the outside edge. 146kph, length and angled in at off stump. Then it straigthens off the surface as he looks to defend this with half a stride

4174___0

4174___12.1

4174___Ferguson to Mohammad Hafeez, FOUR runs, shot! Short ball stays about hip height and Hafeez gets on his back toe, swivels, and launches this to the square leg boundary. Classy

4174___4

4174___12.2

4174___No square leg goes out. Backward short leg stays in.

4174___Ferguson to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, beaten. Hangs inside the line again, bigger stride, but not any closer to nailing the forward defence

4174___Ferguson to Mohammad Hafeez, 1 run, length outside off, dabs it down to third man with an open face

4174___1

4174___12.6

4174___Asking a batsman to choose between his centuries can be tough. But we can ask you in our poll, which was the better Lockie delivery: the yorker to Faf or the fearsome bouncer to Imam. Go, vote.

4174___0

4174___14.1

4174___Ferguson to Mohammad Hafeez, FOUR runs, but he's figured this out! Glorious weight transfer to get on top. In the corridor, a tad shorter than before but he makes enough room and opens the face to get it past point

4174___4

4174___14.2

4174___Ferguson to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, yorker from wide of the crease and he manages to keep the front leg leg side of it to jam it out

4174___0

4174___14.3

4174___Ferguson to Mohammad Hafeez, FOUR runs, oh beautiful. Another short ball at waist height. Not too different in line from the one he punched through point, but this time he's swiveled and used the angle to find the long leg boundary. Rolls the wrists on it to keep it down

4174___4

4174___14.4

4174___Ferguson to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, bouncer hits him on the grille. 142kph. Ferguson's had enough of the short ball that doesn't rise up. This is banged in, a proper bouncer. And Hafeez is swiping hopefully from under it. Flush in the grille. He's on his feet though

4174___0

4174___15.5

4174___de Grandhomme to Mohammad Hafeez, FOUR runs, smash. Short and wide at 117kph and he will not miss out. Gets the weight on the back foot and chops it past point

4174___4

4174___15.6

4174___And that'll be drinks. All in all a decent recovery after Imam's wicket.

4174___Abhijato: "Babar needs to play within himself today. People tend to criticise him for his slow strike rate, but this chase is custom-built for him to anchor with a classical knock out of an ODI in the 90s. If he does win it for his team, the tournament table is going to open up furthermore, and the fourth playoff spot's occupation will become as unpredictable as this Pakistan team.."

4174___Ferguson to Babar Azam, FOUR runs, oh, so elegant. Length ball just outside off and he seems to have enough time to get forward to this and open the face at just the right moment. On the up, flies past point

4174___4

4174___16.1

4174___Ferguson to Babar Azam, 1 run, short and in the corridor, gets leg side of it and dabs it past slip

4174___1

4174___0

4174___16.3

4174___Ferguson to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, past the edge. Again. he keeps straightening the incoming ball to beat Hafeez's outside edge. At 147kph

4174___0

4174___16.4

4174___Ferguson to Mohammad Hafeez, 1 wide, short and very wide. Called for the height and the crowd erupts

4174___1w

4174___16.5

4174___Ferguson to Mohammad Hafeez, no run, outside edge falls short of Taylor at slip! Oh Lockie must be seething right now. Hafeez has managed to get bat on one, another one that has straigthened, but there's no luck for him still

4174___0

4174___17.1

4174___Santner to Babar Azam, 1 run, short of a length outside off, punched to extra cover's right. Dive and parried to long-off

4174___0

4174___18.3

4174___Neesham to Babar Azam, no run, beaten. Loose from Babar. Short of a length outside off and he has a stab at it outside off to try and get it to third man

4174___0

4174___18.4

4174___Neesham to Babar Azam, no run, leading edge trickles past the bowler. Slight mix-up as mid-on gets down at this, but he says no in time. Short of a length on leg, closes the face too early on the flick

4174___0

4174___18.5

4174___Neesham to Babar Azam, FOUR runs, oh yes. More of that, sir. Short and up in the corridor and he plays just about the perfect square drive. Right on top of it, contact right under his eyes, elbow nice and high and the bat face not opened till it was required. Blazes to point's left

4174___0

4174___21.1

4174___Santner to Babar Azam, 2 runs, that's the line. Just fuller than good length and that's where Santner is getting his prodigious turn. Babar runs it down to third man, but wasn't quite in control

4174___2

4174___21.2

4174___Santner to Babar Azam, no run, jaffa. Pitched on middle and leg and turned away. Babar had no answer, and did well to miss it in the end

4174___1

4174___Kane Williamson coming on to bowl. Not a massive surprise, given how Santner has spun it

4174___Williamson to Babar Azam, 1 run, full, and dug away to point for one

4174___1

4174___24.1

4174___Williamson to Mohammad Hafeez, OUT, and that's the most Hafeez way to get out! The man who holed out to Aaron Finch and lost his wicket to Aiden Markram now charges down the pitch to Williamson, and smashes it right down cow corner's throat. In the xact spot he gave it away against Australia

4174___W

4174___24.5

4174___Haris Sohail comes in. He needs a cooler head than the departing batsman just showed

4174___Nabeel Nisar: "Show me a better love story than Hafeez throwing away his wicket to part timer bowler "

4174___25.1

4174___28.1

4174___Williamson to Haris Sohail, FOUR runs, good shot. Opens the face of the bat and scythes it past the man at 45, and sees it race down to the boundary. Williamson is easier to play for Haris, with the ball going away

4174___4

4174___29.3

4174___Santner to Haris Sohail, SIX runs, finally some aggression. Haris races down the track, and gets to the pitch off the ball, and deposits it into the stand behind midwicket. The pressure release is like the pop of a balloon

4174___Boult to Haris Sohail, SIX runs, drilled! Haris picks the full ball outside off, gets his back leg off the pitch as he connects and finishes the full swing to get it over Boult's head. Flat and just clears the boundary. Might have been a slower ball, but it doesn't matter

4174___6

4174___37.4

4174___Boult to Haris Sohail, no run, length on off stump, defended solidly on the back foot

4174___END OF OVER:38 | 8 Runs | PAK: 172/3 (66 runs required from 12 overs, RR: 4.52, RRR: 5.50)

4174___Williamson to continue

4174___Williamson to Babar Azam, no run, length on leg stump, shoveled straight to short fine

4174___0

4174___38.1

4174___Williamson to Babar Azam, 1 run, short and in at leg stump, pulled to deep backward square

4174___1

4174___38.2

4174___Julian Branscom: "How different might it have felt for Pakistan if Boult came back a couple of overs earlier? Hindsight is often under-rated as a good captaincy trait." --- My guess is Williamson feels the extra pace is suiting these batsmen

4174___Williamson to Haris Sohail, 1 run, short of a length outside off, tucked into the leg side off the back foot

4174___1

4174___38.3

4174___Williamson to Babar Azam, 1 run, length on middle stump, flicks off the inside half to deep square

4174___1

4174___Williamson to Haris Sohail, no run,

4174___0

4174___38.5

4174___Williamson to Haris Sohail, FOUR runs, shot! Sublime from Haris. Just world class. This is tossed up outside off, very slow. Grips a shade as he gets forward but he's managed to extend the arms and place this drive past extra cover. It's not an easy shot on this pitch, even with the turn. The timing had to be perfect

4174___1

4174___39.1

4174___Santner to Haris Sohail, no run, length outside off, flicked straight to backward square leg

4174___0

4174___39.2

4174___Santner to Haris Sohail, no run, length ball pitches off stump, turns sharply down leg side. Stumping appeal turned down and, interestingly, not called wide. He had shuffled to try and flick

4174___0

4174___39.3

4174___Santner to Haris Sohail, 1 run, short of a length and in at off stump, backs away and punches to sweeper cover

4174___1

4174___39.4

4174___Santner to Babar Azam, 2 runs, misfield Guptill at extra cover. Full on off stump, harmlessly driven to extra cover and no run turns to two. He had the barrier and all, but this goes through

4174___2

4174___39.5

4174___Santner to Babar Azam, no run, length at off stump, punched to extra cover where Guptill is on the floor to stop this

4174___0

4174___END OF OVER:40 | 4 Runs | PAK: 183/3 (55 runs required from 60 balls, RR: 4.57, RRR: 5.50)

4174___Right, let's do this once and for all. 10 overs, 55 runs, 7 wickets

4174___Boult to Haris Sohail, 1 run, short and a bit of width. Sliced clear of point and Matt Henry does well to cut it off

4174___1

4174___40.1

4174___Prasanth: "This is just an awful spot to be in as a captain for Williamson. Needs wickets to have any shot at winning this. But the main strike bowler might leak a fifth of the remaining runs in one over."

4174___Boult to Babar Azam, no run, blocked, nearly chopped on by Babar. Boult bowling a little short

4174___0

4174___40.2

4174___Boult to Babar Azam, no run, that's full but wide. Half-volley length, really. He's lucky Babar doesn't make him pay

4174___0

4174___40.3

4174___Boult to Babar Azam, 1 run, bouncer that Babar guides down to midwicket. That's all Pakistan need. No heroics, no fireworks

4174___1

4174___40.4

4174___Boult to Haris Sohail, no run, angled to point

4174___0

4174___40.5

4174___Boult to Haris Sohail, FOUR runs, gorgeous touch from Haris. Just opened the face of the bat and got it sooo fine. Absolutely raced away, and third man had no chance. Six of what was shaping up to be a tight over

4174___END OF OVER:41 | 6 Runs | PAK: 189/3 (49 runs required from 54 balls, RR: 4.60, RRR: 5.44)

4174___Santner to Babar Azam, FOUR runs, short boundary towards midwicket, and Babar slog sweeps it right there. Didn't care about how much it might spin, just hit across the line and got it right in the middle of the bat

4174___4

4174___41.1

4174___Santner to Babar Azam, FOUR runs, Copy and paste! Copy and paste! Exactly the same delivery, and if possible, an even more commanding shot. The same spot

4174___4

4174___41.2

4174___Santner to Babar Azam, 1 run, and prods to short third man and scuttles down to the other end. Santner is being seen off, and somehow, he's wicketless

4174___1

4174___41.3

4174___Santner to Haris Sohail, 1 run, helped to the offside. Pakistan are, would you believe it, being sensible. SENSIBLE!!

4174___1

4174___41.4

4174___Santner to Babar Azam, 1 run, slashed away to deep extra cover. the 200 is up, and Babar is 11 short of his 10th hundred

4174___1

4174___41.5

4174___Santner to Haris Sohail, 1 run, glanced away for one. Excellent over for Pakistan

4174___Cricketshire: "Pakistan being Pakistan scrwed it up in WC earlier and now Pakistan being Pakistan is slowly pulling it back in WC. Oh Pakistan, you split personality! "

4174___Boult to Haris Sohail, no run, stump-to-stump, defended right back

4174___0

4174___42.1

4174___Boult to Haris Sohail, 1 run, whipped odwn to square leg. Right, New Zealand need to break through now. 2.4 overs of Boult and one from Santner left. I reckon we see Lockie soon now, too

4174___1

4174___42.2

4174___Boult to Babar Azam, 2 runs, too full and wide from Boult and stroked away to extra cover. Brilliant work from Colin Munro on the boundary to save four. Boult not quite hitting his lengths here

4174___2

4174___42.3

4174___Boult to Babar Azam, no run, cutter. Babar wanted to slash this through extra cover but no timing on it

4174___0

4174___42.4

4174___Boult to Babar Azam, no run, better from Boult, blocked by Babar

4174___0

4174___42.5

4174___Boult to Babar Azam, no run, wild flash from Babar. He wants a wide there, but umpire unmoved. Pakistan 34 away now, and in truth, doing this at a canter

4174___Santner's final over. Can he conjure something up?

4174___Santner to Haris Sohail, no run, sharp turn, but Haris fends him off

4174___0

4174___43.1

4174___Santner to Haris Sohail, 1 run, and again. Intelligently played, tucking it into a gap and turning the strike over

4174___1

4174___43.2

4174___Santner to Babar Azam, no run, good line. Defended

4174___0

4174___43.3

4174___Santner to Babar Azam, 2 runs, dragged it down and Babar muscles it through the onside and race back for two

4174___2

4174___Bilal: "Pak won by 7 wickets against New Zealand in 1992 as well. what a co-incidence." Oh dear. Make it stop, please. Too spooky

4174___Boult to Haris Sohail, no run, lovely delivery. Haris wanted to run him down to third man again, but almost took his edge instead

4174___0

4174___44.1

4174___Boult to Haris Sohail, no run, and again. Just beats the edge again. Good battle, this, and a key, key over

4174___0

4174___44.2

4174___Boult to Haris Sohail, 2 runs, gets his cut away this time. Stops the boundary but Haris brings up his second consecutive half-century. Where was he all this while? Oh, warming the bench. How classically Pakistani

4174___2

4174___44.3

4174___Boult to Haris Sohail, 2 runs, whipped away to the onside, and that brings up the 100-partnership. How crucial has this been for Pakistan, and how unlikely it looked when Santner weaved his magic in his first spell. The two most in-form batsmen for Pakistan look like they're guiding them home, keeping them alive

4174___2

4174___44.4

4174___Boult to Haris Sohail, no run, bouncer but doesn't quite have the fizz on it. Haris chooses not to bother with it

4174___0

4174___44.5

4174___Sankalp: "Is there no twist in the tale? Come on Mr. Commentator, conjure up some jinx or something!" Even I'm surprised

4174___Boult to Haris Sohail, FOUR runs, magnificent. The confidence oozing through his veins. Drives Boult on the up through extra cover, as if people should do this to Boult all the time. Trickles down for four, and the fight is seeping out of New Zealand at last

4174___Giri: "Poor captaincy from Williamson. Dragged it too long before going to his main bowlers."

4174___Ferguson to Babar Azam, no run, slower delivery. Beats Babar's attempt to guide it to third man

4174___0

4174___45.1

4174___Ferguson to Babar Azam, 1 run, wide yorker, and this time he does get it to third man

4174___1

4174___45.2

4174___Ferguson to Haris Sohail, 1 run, nails the yorker, but Haris digs it out and scampers through. Babar six away from a hundred

4174___1

4174___45.3

4174___Ferguson to Babar Azam, 1 run, short ball, upper-cut to third man. It's almost eerie how drama-free this chase suddenly is. This is the moment Pakistan tend to self-destruct

4174___1

4174___45.4

4174___Ferguson to Haris Sohail, 1 wide, another bouncer. Given a wide

4174___1w

4174___45.5

4174___Ferguson to Haris Sohail, 1 run, took his eyes off that bouncer, but still managed to get it in the middle of the blade.

4174___1

4174___45.5

4174___Ferguson to Babar Azam, FOUR runs, spectacular. Princely! Babar pulls to cow corner and the ball absolutely gallops to the rope for four. Pakistan's MVP is on 99

4174___Malik Murad : "I think Williamson got too excited after taking Hafeez's wicket and bowled 8 overs. He should have created more pressure at that time. " To be fair, everyone got excited

4174___Boult to Haris Sohail, no run, off stump line, Haris offers a straight bat

4174___0

4174___46.1

4174___Boult to Haris Sohail, 1 run, pulled to fine leg, and this is the moment. Babar on 99, Babar on strike

4174___1

4174___46.2

4174___Boult to Babar Azam, no run, eyes lit up, but the cut shot didn't have the placement

4174___0

4174___46.3

4174___Boult to Babar Azam, no run, excellent delivery, just seamed away and evaded Babar's drive. The crowd gasps. They're expectant, but also tense

4174___0

4174___46.4

4174___Boult to Babar Azam, no run, getting excited, was Babar. Looked to use his wrists and nudge it down to fine leg, but got a leading edge. Needs to keep his focus

4174___0

4174___46.5

4174___Boult to Babar Azam, no run, straight to the fielder at cover-point. Babar will have to wait another over, at least. Good over from Boult, who is also bowled out. Began with much promise, but couldn't quite follow it up

4174___Ferguson to Haris Sohail, FOUR runs, beautifully played. This is a 90mph bowler, but Haris had so much time. Opened the face of the bat and played it right under his nose, and sliced it through the backward point/third man gap

4174___4

4174___47.1

4174___Ferguson to Haris Sohail, 1 run, driven to mid-off, and they change ends. Babar on strike again, and the crowd falls silent in nervous excitement

4174___1

4174___47.2

4174___Ferguson to Babar Azam, 1 run, and here it is! The 10th hundred for Babar Azam, and perhaps his most precious. Short and wide, and Babar slashes it away to deep cover before embracing Haris. The crowd goes wild, and every cheer is well deserved. The look on his face tells you how much it meant

4174___1

4174___47.3

4174___Ferguson to Haris Sohail, no run, good bouncer, Top edged into Haris's grill. No harm done, though, he's fine

4174___0

4174___47.4

4174___Ferguson to Haris Sohail, 1 wide, quick bouncer, but Bruce Oxenford reckons it's too high. Wide called, and Pakistan one hit away.

4174___1w

4174___47.5

4174___Ferguson to Haris Sohail, 2 runs, full toss that Haris times nicely over extra cover. Another two, and now a boundary will do it. Will it come off this delivery?

4174___2

4174___47.5

4174___Ferguson to Haris Sohail, no run, slower ball deceived him. Still four to go

4174___Hold the press - Matt Henry's here! Lots of you missed him.

4174___Farhan: "Haris Sohail, what a commanding batter he is. Shows glimpses of Inzi & Yuvi."

4174___Henry to Babar Azam, 1 run, smeared through the onside. They're doing this in singles now

4174___1

4174___48.1

4174___Henry to Haris Sohail, 1 run, helped down to fine leg

4174___1

4174___48.2

4174___Haris Sohail run out (Guptill) 68 (98m 76b 5x4 2x6) SR: 89.47

4174___Henry to Babar Azam, OUT, is that gone? The third umpire is involved! Slower ball that Babar deadbatted but Haris absolutely hared through for one. He's short of his ground! Haris falls for a well-made 68

4174___W

4174___48.3

4174___Anyhow, the captain's here

4174___Lots of you pointed out Pakistan beat NZ by 7 wickets in '92. That will not happen now. Has Haris unjinxed it all?

4174___Henry to Sarfaraz Ahmed, no run, Sarfaraz jabbed it through backward point and wanted a single, but Babar sends him back

4174___0

4174___48.4

4174___Henry to Sarfaraz Ahmed, 1 run, comes through for one that time. Tucked into the on-side, and the scores are level

4174___1

4174___48.5

4174___Fahim: "In 1992 SF Pakistan won by 4 wickets not 7" In the group stages it was 7 wkts

4174___Henry to Babar Azam, no run, straight to mid-on. Babar will not hit the winning runs, it seems. We're going to the final six balls

4174___Ferguson to bowl the final over

4174___Ferguson to Sarfaraz Ahmed, FOUR runs, full toss, and Sarfaraz smashes it through point. Massive win for Pakistan!

4174___4

4174___49.1

4174___Mickey Arthur runs down the changing room with an arm around Shaheen Afridi, a wide grin on his face. His team is not going down without a fight, and that is all he;s asked of them.

4174___Don't write them off just yet. They are one point behind England and level with Bangladesh. A mature chase, shepherded by a young man with a head far wiser than his 24 years would suggest. NZ suffer their first defeat of the 2019 World Cup, and their first group stage defeat in 8 years.

4174___7:30pm Edgbaston explodes and the Pakistan players rush onto the field. They've copped an absolute truckload of criticism and been written off, but a comprehensive win over South Africa and a clinical one over NZ today have seen them storm back into contention!

4174___Babar Azam is the Man of the Match.

4174___Babar: This is my best innings. the wicket was difficult and turned a lot in the second half. The plan was to go through to the end and give my 100%. When we started, the plan was to see out Ferguson. But when Santner came on, the plan became not to give wickets to him and cover up later when the fast bowlers come on. The fans support us here in Birmingham, it's great. 

4174___Williamson: We've seen it in our last three games, where the surfaces have offered to the bowlers and made life difficult. We were outplayed by a strong Pakistan side. I think there was a little bit more bounce than we experienced on the same surface we played the other day. The fight that was shown in the middle and back end was good, to get us in a position where we were competitive. But that partnership with Babar and Haris, they took it from us. [Shadab] yeah it was nice wasn't it? We tried to soak it up. Thought if we get 230-250, there was a chance. And there was, but they soaked up the pressure and played really nicely. When the threat is spin, especially when the wicket became a lot slower, we were trying to get anybody in there who would rotate the ball. There's so many games in the round robin that you're not expecting to win them all. There's things we need to iron out. We'll have to adapt a little better than we did today.

4174___Sarfraz: The crowd is always behind the Pakistan team. Thank you very much. Fielding is a very important part. Unfortunately we didn't do well in the previous matches. We practiced hard. The way we played today, it was a great team effort. All the bowlers did really well and in the end Babar and Haris - one of the finest batting I've ever seen. We knew 240 was not an easy target on this pitch. We just wanted to bat 50 overs. Credit to Babar and Haris, the way they played on this pitch. [On 1992] when the World Cup starts, people think that way. But we're not thinking like that. Our focus is the next match. We are very confident and hopefully we'll do well.

4174___7:45pm And that is all! Thanks for joining us through the day. Good night.
