4150___9am Welcome to Southampton, where two-time champions India finally get their World Cup campaign going. This is Debayan Sen, and I will be joined today by Liam Brickhill, as we look to see if South Africa lose three on the bounce or can actually put some of their recent miseries behind with a win. Liam has that, and more, in the preview

4150___Four years ago, India won their first in four matches in World Cups against South Africa. That was on the back of a big hundred by Shikhar Dhawan. What must they do today, especially against the four most dangerous players in the South African setup? Aakash Chopra gives us some hints on what the Indian gameplan should be against de Kock, du Plessis, Rabada and Tahir here

4150___Raj Patel: "Hey Debayan! Welcome ... It's a holiday here in UAE for Eid and looks like I've found the perfect company for holiday."

4150___Neil Gokhale : "What's the weather today? @Deb , we'll get a full game right?" --- Always difficult to hazard a guess in England, but I can tell you that the BBC forecast for Southampton says 'sunny intervals and a moderate breeze'

4150___DrD: "Good afternoon Debayan, do you think India should start the bowling with one of the spinners? " --- Could consider it, especially if they go in with two specialist spinners. The only thing to factor in whether they are bowling first or second, and what the overhead conditions will be like then

4150___Dhaval : "Hi Deb: Been on this window since half an hour refreshing every Five minutes. I just remember one line of Kris Srikanth when we won the WC in 2011. It's all about positive energy from the Billion fans of India. We all need to give the same positive energy to our Team if we expect them to Win the Cup. Come on India, we are firmly behind you. #BleedBlue " --- For the sake of this World Cup, though, a South Africa win today would be most welcome. Helps them stay in the hunt and not fall too far behind, and means both of the pre-tournament favourites will have lost one match early

4150___Snehil: "Just heard that India will sport Orange Jerseys for the match against England due to the ICC rules. Finding it hard to imagine Indian team in any other jersey other than blue. Any suggestions? " --- Would only pass a verdict once we have seen them in the field in those colours, I suppose. I think it's orange/saffron with a swish or two of green. Might be reminiscent of the Ivory Coast football team, in some ways!

4150___joe: "hello there..watching from Zimbabwe..what an exciting cwc..sad we missed out....well i do think these fixtures needed some reviewing..how can India be playing 1st game against SA playing a third game??" --- Hi Joe, glad to have you on this commentary feedback. I agree with you on both counts - Zimbabwe definitely were one of the nations that would have made this a better World Cup, AND India playing a first match the same day South Africa are playing their third is simply laughable. Handing over to Liam now so he can share his thoughts on the same...

4150___09.15am Mangwanani Joe and, indeed, everyone tuning in to our coverage. Don't get me started on Zimbabwe's absence from this tournament. I was at HSC the day they fell to UAE, by three runs, and tbh I've not quite recovered yet, a year-plus later. As for India's late start, that's a result of the Lodha Commission's recommendation which requires a 15-day window between the last IPL match and the first international fixture, and which the ICC have agreed to honour. One person who definitely doesn't mind India's late start is Virat Kohli, who reckons it will give his side an advantage in sussing out conditions and strategies

4150___Madhu: "Deb, does the pitch helps spinners or pace attack?" -- Madhu, I can tell you that, over the last five matches played here, the quicks average 58.4 with an economy of 6.4, while spinners average 60.1 with an economy of 6.0. So, neither?

4150___Duncan Ward: "Any news on Amla's fitness for today?" -- Nothing yet, first thing, but he had a net yesterday and had been passed fit to play.

4150___Anshul: "@Joe @Liam Actually it was mandated by the Supreme Court of India to the COA that there should be 15 days gap between the last match of IPL and India's next international match, which ICC honored."

4150___Snehil: "Just heard that India will sport Orange Jerseys for the match against England due to the ICC rules. Finding it hard to imagine Indian team in any other jersey other than blue. Any suggestions? " -- Eh, it works for the Dutch!

4150___Balaji Penumall: "Hello Liam, I am here in Johannesburg where I am the only Indian in an office full of South Africans. I don't know if I can cheer loudly for India :-P" -- I reckon you'll be fine Balaji. South Africans are a passionate bunch when it comes to sports, but also tend to appreciate the passion in others. JUST DON'T MENTION THE 'C' WORD

4150___9.28pm We're about half an hour from the toss in Southampton. Meanwhile, Virat Kohli's good friend and Indian national football captain Sunil Chhetri takes the pitch for the first time under new coach Igor Stimac at the King's Cup in Thailand. Follow all the live updates from their tournament opener against Curacao right here

4150___Siddhesh Rane: "Local time is 4:22 am in USA east coast and there it too much excitement for our first game.The toss is going to be super crucial and Virat has not been winning much in that department. South Africa will be keen to attack from the onset but we should be able to settle in quickly. Let's do this Team India #BleedBlue "

4150___Sameer: "Considering South Africa's track record against spin, would you consider playing 2 specialist fast bowlers Bumrah and Shami with 2 specialist spinners Chahal and Kuldeep with Jadeja as all rounder ? Also what is the news on Kedar Jadhav ? Would you play Rahul in case Kedar is not fit ?" -- The news yesterday was that Kedar was fit. I'd definitely consider playing full KulCha against South Africa, considering their stellar record against the Proteas, and a general ambivalence towards spin in South Africa's middle order. Indeed, Chahal v de Kock could be a key battle - Quinny averages just 5 against Chahal, having been dismissed twice by him in the space of 17 deliveries.

4150___Greg: "Regardless of the fact that this is India's first match and the reasons for it, it's still absurd that S Africa have been forced to play 3 matches in under a week. Most teams are yet to even play their second match... Also strange scheduling 2 matches for today with arguably one of the more interesting matchups so far (SA and IND), whereas just 1 game was held yesterday with arguably one of the less interesting ones..."

4150___Jay kamdar: "Morning from East coast USA ! Do we have the playing XI decided yet?" -- Not yet, but soon!

4150___Karthik Siram: "Hello and good morning from Poland! I am at work and I can't see the match. Thanks to Cricinfo commentary, I will be constantly updated. #pleasure" -- Welcome, Karthik!

4150___South Africa's injury list might have made your fantasy XI selections easier, but whom do you pick from the Indian lot? Some rather interesting recommendations on our fantasy tips for this game

4150___9.40am South Africa are in a tight spot. Not only do they have to win, probably, five of their next seven games in order to have a shot at the (historically, dreaded) knockouts, but their team has been ravaged by injuries. "There are lots of things haunting me at the moment," captain Faf du Plessis admitted ahead of this India clash.

4150___9.42am Meanwhile, in Southampton, our very own Nagraj Gollapudi reckons he might have a handle on India's playing XI. From the warm-ups, it appears Vijay, Shami and Jadeja are sitting out today.

4150___Ravi: "Hello and good morning from Zambia... neighboring country of South Africa. At work and only source of getting live updates is Cricninfo and this is a routine for last 5 years. Thank you guys. "

4150___pat: "Mangwanani Liam, because of Zim's absence have decided to stay patriotic and support SA. Hoping they can pull a big surprise today. Given their injury woes a win would certainly be a major upset. The Cricket fan in me wants to see this one go down to the wire. "

4150___Some love from South Africa's neighbours in the feedback. Long live internationalism!

4150___RV: "Hi there from Washington DC! Cannot wait for the two time world champions, last world cup's semi finalist and one of the favorites for this world up to kick start their campaign FINALLY. Biting nails already, wondering what's the atmosphere at Hampshire Bowl. Ain't going to work today for sure. Let's do this Men in Blue!! Jai Hind."

4150___Nainesh Patel: "How's weather looking? Can we expect any rain interruptions? I would personally hate to have any interruption as I have been waiting for the India game for long." -- So far, the weather looks fair. Lots of fluffy cloud, but no rain. It was raining yesterday though ... "A little cloudy, but otherwise good," says Andrew Fidel Fernando, who is at the ground.

4150___Bryan DE: "Everyone is talking about the important Stakeholder meeting at work and I'm like, can we please discuss about today's playing XIs or at least Dale's exit from the WC? aber nein, meeting it is then! #lifeofcricketfansingermany #Germany " -- Stakeholder meeting? Bah! The kartoffelkopfs!

4150___Elsewhere, the Indian football team has just begun life under new coach Igor Stimac at the King's Cup in Thailand. You can follow LIVE updates from India vs Curacao here.

4150___Pulkit: "Hi from Paris, I am the only Indian in office. Have opened cricinfo on a side tab. Just have to make sure not to look too excited when Bumrah strikes " -- Ah, the ol' tab game hey. I know it well

4150___Prasanna S: "Not sure what's the logic behind SA playing 3 games in a World cup under a week, given that they played the opening game too. Players also can get injured in such a quick turnaround and it can be mentally draining in a WC turning up this quickly. The schedule should be very fair and should give teams enough time to regroup and come stronger, in a tournament that's played every 4 years. "

4150___Navin: "Talking about Internationalism, A huge shout out from Sweden !!! Comin to the game, No one would prefer to play their first match against a wounded South African team, But nevertheless its good to start the tourney against the most competitive sides !!"

4150___Shahzad Siddiqu: "Cricinfo Rocks. I am a Pakistani with Indian family roots settled in Frankfurt am Main DE and following WC on cricinfo during workdays. SA has their back (side ) against the wall, I am expecting a cracker of a game today. I trust India to win but they will definitely have to work hard today to get over the line. "

4150___anees zed: "Liam, shall I attach my Pay Cheque with my comment?" -- Yes, that would be very useful!

4150___DBS: "Washroom-done. Lunch-Don't care. Mobile battery-Full. Internet lease in office-Renewed. meetings-Delayed. Am I ready for India's WC campaign to start?" -- Sounds like it!

4150___9.58am The toss is coming up in a minute or two

4150___=======================================================================

4150___* While bowling in tandem, the duo has taken 18 wickets striking once in every 18.7 deliveries, the best record for them while bowling in tandem against an opposition in ODIs.

4150___* Kuldeep has taken a wicket once in every 18 deliveries against SA, his best against any opposition in ODIs.

4150___* Chahal has taken a wicket once in every 19.6 balls against SA, his best against any opposition in ODIs.

4150___Good move to play the wrist spinners, reckons our very own Gaurav Sundararaman. The last time India played an ODI series against South Africa was back in Feb 2017, where India won the series 5-1. The spin twins played a crucial part in India's first away series victory in ODIs at South Africa. Kuldeep and Chahal picked 33 of the 53 wickets (62%) India took in the series.

4150___KulCha Stat Attack!

4150___Amogh K: "Why not choose Markram over either Duminy/Miller? They both are doing just fine and so is Aiden but it also ensures that there aren't a lot of left-handers in the middle order. Markram is an attacking player and can help to quickly catch-up with the run rate. " -- I do feel Markram is a little unlucky. Perhaps they're hiding him from KulCha? He's had a torrid time against them in the past

4150___A lot of Duminy's troubles are a result of his inability to neither score at a good rate in the middle overs not avoid getting out. 19 of his 24 dismissals in this period have come in the 11-40 over phase and for an SR of 73.75. South Africa would want to look at different options once the tournament gets over, but for the time being, they are better off using him in a way he plays majority of his innings in the 41-50 over phase.

4150___Vishnu : "SA still playing Duminy is a big mystery to me. He is way past his prime. Markram should have been given another go." -- Yep, Duminy's numbers ain't great. Given his returns in the last 3 years, it is inexplicable how he continues to be part of the XI. He only has 3 fifties in the 31 innings he has played in this period at an average of 30 and SR of 86.5.

4150___Andrew: "I just hope South Africa has not made a mistake by playing Amla. We love the guy, but he is not himself."

4150___Pancham Singh : "Based on current form, Bhuvi playing instead of shami is shocking. Hope Bhuvi finds his rhythm today." -- Perhaps they're expecting a little swing today. Bhuvi will have a tough job, as South Africa are likely to target him. Faf du Plessis has really taken him on in the past, with a strike rate of 130.8 and an average of 85 over six innings. Amla has scored a little more slowly at 72.4, but over an extended time of 12 innings, he's averaged 97 against Bhuvneshwar. De Kock, meanwhile, has scored 144 runs off 140 balls he has faced from Bhuvi in ODIs, and never been dismissed by him.

4150___sravan: "To be honest, the Indian lineup looks full strength and as complete as can get. Quite imposing!"

4150___Kaleem : "I smell both India and Pakistan in top 4" -- hey, hey, hey, Anyone who makes smell jokes has a terrible scents of humour ... Smell ya later!

4150___Niks: "Niks from London - My boss is South African and came over to my desk this morning as a teaser before this match ... Not sure if I should buy him a drink if India wins today ;) #Job Vs Passsion !!" -- If that happens, Niks, he's going to need a drink (or three)

4150___Sai: "No Jadeja in the team ! A little bit harsh on their best fielder ... Also , with slow over rates becoming a major issue nowadays , Jadeja is a must have in the team .. "

4150___Right, thoughts on today's selections. GO!

4150___South Africa: 1 Quinton de Kock (wk), 2 Hashim Amla, 3 Faf du Plessis (c), 4 Rassie van der Dussen, 5 David Miller, 6 JP Duminy, 7 Andile Phehlukwayo, 8 Chris Morris, 9 Kagiso Rabada, 10 Tabraiz Shamsi, 11 Imran Tahir

4150___India: 1 Rohit Sharma, 2 Shikhar Dhawan, 3 Virat Kohli (c), 4 KL Rahul, 5 Kedar Jadhav, 6 MS Dhoni (wk), 7 Hardik Pandya, 8 Bhuvneshwar Kumar, 9 Kuldeep Yadav, 10 Yuzvendra Chahal, 11 Jasprit Bumrah

4150___Both sides have opted to play two wristspinners

4150___Meanwhile, Bhuvneshwar Kumar plays ahead of Mohammad Shami today! And KL Rahul has leapfrogged ahead of Vijay Shankar into that vital No. 4 spot.

4150___"The crowd support is going to be massive for us," says Virat Kohli. "We're pretty used to the crowds wanting us to win. It's about keeping our composure and being professional about what we do. We've seen a few games happen in the tournament, the pattern of play, and how teams are playing. There's a lot to learn from that. It's a very balanced bowling attack that we have. The reason we have both spinners playing comes from the series we played against South Africa and the way those two dominated the middle overs. There's no bigger motivation than representing your country, let alone captaining your country at a World Cup."

4150___"It's always a cracker playing against these guys," du Plessis says of playing against India. "Nice and loud. It's a great occasion, looking forward to it."

4150___Hashim Amla and Tabraiz Shamsi come into the playing XI, Faf du Plessis confirms, while South Africa are playing both Morris and Phehlukwayo - two allrounders. Aiden Markram sits this one out.

4150___10.00am Virat calls heads, but it's a tail. South Africa win the toss, and they'll bat

4150___10.25am The teams are being lead onto the outfield for the anthems, and we're minutes away from the start. This is also a good time for me to hand back to Debayan Sen, who will take you through the first hour of play.

4150___Many thanks, Liam. Looking forward to this. Glad that Faf has taken the bold decision of batting first. The batting conditions at most venues this World Cup have been quite good, and they missed a trick for sure against Bangladesh by inserting the opposition in the last game. Up to them now to bat well

4150___Rohit: "I have an inner feeling that it will be shikhar and virat's day." --- Magnanimous of you to say that :)

4150___Bhuvneshwar Kumar takes his cap off and offers it to the umpire. He'll bowl first with the new ball. Slightly overcast from the look of things, which could mean some swing while the ball stays new. Amla and de Kock walk out to join the Indians

4150___Al Muthu's back on the #LiveReport and he's shamelessly playing to the gallery with his latest poll. It's about what you're most looking forward to seeing today. So go, vote, and make him feel even more like a sell-out

4150___Deenadhayal Sub: "5.30 am in New York. I'm on the couch with the Indian Jersey on. What a feel. I'm 32 and I remember watching the 1992 world cup with my grandfather and the whole talk was about the colored jerseys. In 27 years, we are here now with teams having 2 colored jerseys (home and away). The love for this game will never end.. " --- Amla on strike to rekindle those memories #PeterKirsten. Two slips in place for Bhuvi

4150___Kumar to Amla, 1 run, length, and some width, and he cuts this down towards third man

4150___1

4150___0.1

4150___Sudhir: "Duminy for me is wasted at no.6. SA should put him in at 3/4 today surprise Indian bowlers. He can anchor the batting well"

4150___Two slips, point, extra cover and mid off for de Kock

4150___Kumar to de Kock, no run, length, and he plays it away towards square leg

4150___0

4150___0

4150___0.3

4150___Kumar to de Kock, 1 run, length, just outside off, and he plays a forward defensive shot and sets off immediately. Mid off is a bit deep, so they complete the single easily

4150___0.4

4150___Kumar to Amla, no run, length, outside off, and he leaves

4150___0

4150___0.5

4150___Assad: "My country fellows are celebrating Eid and I am following match from Pak... Good Luck Ind"

4150___Avnish Anshu: "@deenadhayal - You remember talking about cricket with your grandfather when you were 5 years old?? You should have been on the ground right now, instead of the couch, given your interest level and ability to talk cricket at such a young age." --- I remember the 1986 (football) World Cup that happened when I was four!

4150___Kumar to Amla, no run, length, outside off, and he plays it defensively

4150___0

4150___0.6

4150___END OF OVER:1 | 2 Runs | SA: 2/0 | RR: 2.00

4150___deep s: "Hey Cricinfo, is Vijay injured today? I see that Kedhar is included in the match, considering the fact that we have 2 full-time spinners already, would Vijay not be a better option??" --- They had a fit squad to choose from

4150___Boom Boom Bumrah next...

4150___Bumrah to de Kock, no run, sharp, length ball, angles across him, and takes the inner edge of de Kock's bat and nestles within his body. Bowled at 137kph

4150___0

4150___1.1

4150___Bumrah to de Kock, no run, shorter in length, and rises further as it angles across de Kock. Started off from outside off, so he let it go. Dhoni collects this in front of first slip

4150___0

4150___1.2

4150___Harish: "Is there any swing for Bhuvi? As that is the only advantage he adds to the team over Shami" --- No, not really

4150___Bumrah to de Kock, no run, length, angles across him, and beats the outside edge. De Kock was looking to defend this, but it just rose and moved away with the natural angle

4150___0

4150___1.3

4150___Bumrah to de Kock, 2 runs, first loose ball, full and on the pads and he gets this away towards fine leg. Hurries Jadhav up and takes two, but had to put in the dive

4150___2

4150___1.4

4150___Bumrah to de Kock, no run, length, angles away from him, and also a hint of swing, as it cuts him in half. De Kock looking to defend, and beaten all ends up!

4150___0

4150___1.5

4150___"De Kock's started this World Cup well with scores 68 and 23. Coming into this series, he didn't have a good record in multi-team tournaments though: averaged just 25.40 from 22 innings in series involving more than two teams. Much worse than his career average of 45.56," says Shiva J

4150___Bumrah to de Kock, no run, action replay of the previous ball. Starts from around leg and middle and then shapes away from him and leaves him with a sheepish smile as it beats his outside edge

4150___Kumar to Amla, no run, length, jags back into him and he has to defend watchfully. The ball trickles away towards point

4150___0

4150___2.2

4150___Krutik: "Bold prediction of the day - Kedar Jadhav will be the highest wicket taker in today's game."

4150___Kumar to Amla, 1 run, length, width again, and he cuts this away towards third man. Kuldep Yadav stationed there

4150___Bumrah to de Kock, 1 bye, another great ball! Comes off a length and jumps up at de Kock, angling away from him, and beats his outside edge, and then Dhoni fails to gather this too. Runs away towards third man. Good pace on that ball too!

4150___Bumrah to Amla, OUT, GOT 'IM! Good length, just outside off, and makes Amla defend from the crease. The extra bounce takes the outside edge, and Rohit Sharma pouches this at second slip, moving slightly across to his right. Just reward for what has been a terrific opening burst by Bumrah

4150___W

4150___3.2

4150___Abhijato: "Sent in a comment with two predictions from Crystal Ball: Indian Top Three to do well, and Bumrah to do very well. The latter has come true already! What an absolute star this young man is :)"

4150___Jon: "I remember watching Bumrah for the first time several years ago in the IPL and thought he was a considerably average bowler. But in the last few years he's been without doubt the best ODI bowler by a long shot. Delighted to be proven so wrong and now love watching him." --- I think his best virute is that he learns things very fast

4150___Kumar to du Plessis, 2 runs, length ball, angles into him, and he punches this off the back foot towards long leg

4150___2

4150___Shiva on the Bhuvi selection: "Interesting choice not to play Mohammed Shami today. He would've been a handful for South Africa's top order: South Africa's top three against Shami in ODI - 4 dismissals, average of 17.25. Bhuvneshwar Kumar averages 163 against them with 1 dismissal. The Indian think-tank must have felt that Bhuvneshwar is better equipped to exploit the early swinging conditions."

4150___Bumrah to de Kock, OUT, Bumrah has TWO! He's bowled better balls than this one, to be honest. Throws it a bit wide, but still fuller than most, and de Kock has a swish at it, and the outside edge carries it through to Kohli at third slip. That's one major blow for South African hopes

4150___Pushkaraj: "Apart from the exploitation of the swinging conditions, Bhuvi's batting skills might have also played a part in his selection. Remember his innings at Lords' 5 years ago alongside Rahane in the Test match. My crystal ball says it will be Bhuvi with the bat in the end today to take India home."

4150___Which is not to say India's bowlers shouldn't take much of the credit - they should, but they've undoubtedly been helped by some variable (and sometimes alarming) bounce in the track. It's spinning, too.

4150___Thanks Debayan. Well, I don't know about you, but I've been taken quite by surprise by the character of today's pitch. This is, after all, the same ground where a whopping 734 runs were scored just over three weeks ago in the match between England and Pakistan.

4150___Vinod Rajpal: "Hey Liam, Any thoughts why Faf chose to Bat first ; with No Steyn & Ngidi to defend !!" -- Scoreboard pressure, perhaps? Plus they've picked their two wristspinners

4150___Pandya to van der Dussen, 2 runs, another short one, and for a moment it seemed Rassie wanted to duck this one as well. But instead, he rolls his wrists over a pull and collects a couple out to deep square

Excellent at the death, iffy elsewhere

4150___Chahal to van der Dussen, OUT, GOT HIM! That is not pretty. Not pretty at all. Legspinners can do this to batsmen: make them look foolish. And that's what happens when Rassie telegraphs his intentions to reverse sweep, getting into position very early. But the drift takes the ball towards leg stump, and the rip sends it clattering into the timber. He's already planted his front foot, and can't reach around at the ball. Bowled around his legs!

4150___After a slow start to his career, David Miller finally started doing justice to his potential in 2015, the first season in which his average crossed 40. The left-hander built on it and got even better in the following two years, but his returns have now taken a hit again. South Africa would dearly love an uptick in his fortunes right about now. Oh, and leg slip comes in now

4150___Chahal to Miller, no run, Miller skips out, getting to the pitch, but finds short midwicket

4150___Enter JP Duminy. Like Miller, he could really do with some runs. He only has three fifties in the 31 innings he has played in the last three years at an average of 30 and SR of 86.5. A lot of Duminy's troubles are a result of his inability to neither score at a good rate in the middle overs not avoid getting out. 19 of his 24 dismissals in this period have come in the 11-40 over phase and for an SR of 73.75. In the middle, it's spin from both ends

4150___Kuldeep Yadav to Miller, 1 run, chipped uppishly, but safely through mid off and down to long off for one

4150___1

4150___20.1

4150___D: "Miller is a Finisher. Can be handy fro overs 35-50. Not Sure Why SA is not utilizing JP Duminy services in middle order (4/5 batting positions). He is used to these kind of situations and can anchor the innings very well which is proven in past and is one of the key success of SA."

Statistically, this attack has been their best between World Cups in the last 20 years

It looks adjacent, it's given out, but Duminy reviews it. Needlessly so, it turns out, as three reds come back and he's got to go. It was a little desperate, but given the game situation, Duminy had to ask for another look. South Africa sink ever further

SA for me would be out of SF race due to sheer pressure of winning 5 out of 6 if the lose this one"

4150___Bumrah is back!

4150___Bumrah to Miller, 1 run, full ball, angles across him, and takes the leading edge and flies away towards deep point. Miller closes the face on the ball and gets an edge, but it lands short of the man there

4150___Bumrah to Phehlukwayo, 1 run, length, angles across him. He plays it towards short cover and sets off. Miller has to put in the dive at the striker's end as Kohli has a shy at the stumps...and misses

4150___Nivas: "The tone of all these comments below reminds me of the first test during the last India's tour of South Africa. When India bowled out SA for a score less than 300, everyone were so happy and expected Pujara and co to grind it out and cross 500. But what happened next was a shocker. So, better to control your celebration mood."

4150___Bumrah to Miller, FOUR runs, full ball, but on the pads, and he plays an exquisite flick towards deep midwicket. Gets it wide of the man inside the circle, and then it just keeps running away further from him. Top shot!

Steps out to hoick with the spin but didn't get to the pitch, the ball breaks back in to beat the swing, the inside edge as MS Dhoni effects a stumping after a brief stumble. He was blinded by the swing initially and that may have thrown him off gear. The ball bobbled but he had so much time to regain his composure because Andile was so far down the pitch.

4150___0

4150___44.1

4150___Bumrah to Rabada, no run, full ball, on the pads, and he flicks this towards short midwicket. Goes straight to Kuldeep, who has a shy at the stumps. Kohli is not too impressed, as the non-striker was comfortably in

4150___0

4150___44.2

4150___Is this the best Indian fielding team ever? Sunil Gavaskar doesn't think so. And he's fairly caustic about it.

4150___Kumar to Rabada, 1 leg bye, length ball, opens him up as it angles across him. Runs off his pads after beating the outside edge and runs down towards short third man. They pick up a leg-bye, though

4150___Bumrah to Rabada, 1 run, full ball, and he digs it out and gets it down towards wide long on

4150___1

4150___46.1

4150___SK: "Given the form of Indian openers and the soft under belly, the middle order, 230+ is a challenging total & 250 may be a winning total, not to forget the SA bowlers."

4150___4

4150___46.2

4150___Thys: "At least it looks like SA will bat out their overs, which should have been their first priority after the disastrous start. The runs are on the board, India have to get them. Time for the bowlers to stand up where they have been shown up in the previous two games."

4150___Bumrah to Morris, 1 run, slower ball, outside off, and Dhoni spills a regulation take behind the wicket. They get a bye for this. Good deception with the ball, though, from Bumrah. Brave, with both third man and fine leg inside the circle

4150___1

4150___46.3

4150___Bumrah to Rabada, 2 runs, short, and Rabada goes back and pulls this one in front of square on the leg side. There are two on offer for the batsman, as the man at deep midwicket has to run around to his left

4150___2

4150___46.4

4150___Bumrah to Rabada, no run, short, and this time lifts off a length from outside off. Rabada looks to pull, but was about two postal codes too slow to it!

4150___Predicted score is up to 232 now

4150___Kumar to Rabada, 2 runs, full ball, outside off, and he drives this towards long off. Rahul has some work to do to get to his right, and that allows them to come back for the second

4150___48.4

4150___Sven: "@Ian, anyone that thinks the Proteas have a chance here is holding onto some sort of hope for the underdog, which most neutrals would have in this case. But realistically there is a very small chance of stopping a side with the quality they have in this lineup, and then the level headedness of Dohni in the middle order. This is the best chasing side in the world, add 100 runs to this score and I still believe it would be done pretty easily."

Dhawan feels for the ball from the crease, is opened up the deviation off the pitch as he feathers an edge to de Kock. Big wicket for South Africa. Rabada is pumped, absolutely pumped.

4150___6.3

4150___sinbad: "Do you think India erred in leaving Shami out? Looking at the pace and bounce he would have been a better bet than Bhuvi." -- Surprised by the decision for sure.

4150___1

4150___11.1

4150___Phehlukwayo to Sharma, no run, huge appeal, a massive plea. Was this missing? Faf and his team converge. They review. My impression: going down leg. This one skidded on much faster than Rohit anticipated, was looking to work this to across the line, hit on the flap of the pad. No bat, height and line in question possibly. Ball tracking comes on and it says this would've clipped outside of leg. So the onfield decision stays. NOT OUT.

The ball tends to roll down or pop out along the inner side of the cup more often than not. Having your body behind the cup would act as a natural protection. The reverse cup, as was just witnessed, just comes in the way of the catch."
