4184___Afghanistan: Rahmat Shah, Gulbadin Naib (c), Asghar Afghan, Mohammad Nabi, Samiullah Shinwari, Najibullah Zadran, Ikram Alikhil(wk), Rashid Khan, Dawlat Zadran, Sayed Shirzad, Mujeeb Ur Rahman

4184___10.02am Time for the toss, which West Indies have done and will bat first

4184___10.15am Just 15 minutes to the first ball. Time to say hello to Shashank Kishore

4184___Mohammad Kakar: "What happened to the Pakistan similarity of 1992 World cup!" -- Can be laid to rest now.

4184___Dadrev Mupez: "Today is the best chance for WI to break the 500 run barrier. The Afghans have decent spin but I doubt they will give much of a fight." -- That's stretching it. They'll be happy getting 300.

4184___Shashank Maurya: "Our of the four West Indian players who didn't play in the qualifier final, two are Pooran and Cottrell. I bet these two will have a big role today. Ignore to my comment at your risk, publish them to get credit for my foretelling." -- Published, not because our first name is the same.

4184___Arun Kamboj: "Chris Gayle has the chance today to become the West Indian with the highest ODI runs (overtaking Brian Lara). Would be a great way to sign off form World cups (or possibly international cricket) for the Universe Boss."

4184___10.20am Morning, everyone. Thanks, Debayan. Good to be back. Pity this game has nothing riding on it as far as qualification goes. At best, this is a re-run of last year's WC Qualifiers Final. All the players are walking up to shake hands and give Chris Gayle a hug at the team huddle. Wonder if that's a sign somewhere that this could be his last game for the West Indies. Yes, he's selected himself for the series against India at home but mind you, the selectors are yet to name the squad.

4184___10.25am Time for the anthems, and its 'Rally round the West Indies' first. Followed by 'Daa watan Afghanistan.'

4184___saad owais: "Apparently there is news that the ICC has changed the formula for Pakistan to beat Bangladesh. The news is that if Pakistan make 350 then they need to bowl out Bangladesh for 160. Is that true?" -- Of course it's BOGUS.

4184___Mouneesh Badam: "Naib really needs to perform today if he is to stay in his job as captain (or maybe as a player). Was really poor against the Pakistani lads" -- Well, he's still a young captain. Has gone alright with the bat. As a bowler, some of the best in the business have had a poor tournament. So let's give him the benefit of doubt. Did someone expect Rashid to have a shocker of a tournament?

4184___Remember the World Cup Qualifiers final in Harare last year? Mujeeb bowled the first over, dismissed Gayle with a ripping googly. Will he open the bowling again? How will Gayle tackle him? Let's see.

4184___Confirmation then. It's spin first-up for Gayle. Mujeeb, with whom he's played some cricket at Kings XI Punjab in the IPL, will bowl from around the wicket. Slip in place.

4184___Dawlat Zadran with the new ball from the other end

4184___Aidan: "Shashank, is the format used at this WC being used in 2023? I have enjoyed the idea of everyone playing each other yet can't help but feel a few more Affiliate nations would have added something to the event." -- What we know at this stage is it will be a 10-team event.

4184___Dawlat Zadran to Gayle, 1 run, tucks this gently into the midwicket region as he strolls through for a single

4184___1

4184___1.1

4184___Dhiraj Shetty : "ICC should have kept a weeks gap after the round Robin games to plan for any rained out matches. This would have been fairer to the teams. " -- All of Pakistan agrees with that, surely

4184___Dawlat Zadran to Lewis, no run, slants one across, left alone

4184___0

4184___1.2

4184___Shubham S: "For me Mujeeb is the most underrated bowler in the tournament. He went for a lot of runs in the initial games, but after returning to the squad, he has been economical and has also struck at important junctures. He did it against India, then Pakistan, and he delivered some economical spells in the games played before these two."

4184___Dawlat Zadran to Lewis, no run, gets this to bend back in, Lewis leaves but he did so getting well outside the line. Not sure that would've hit.

4184___0

4184___Dawlat Zadran to Gayle, no run, beaten for pace as this cuts back in to hit him on the thigh pad. Gayle was looking to nudge it into the leg side

4184___0

4184___3.2

4184___Ajay: "I know my comment wont be published But can you guys explain the net run rate calculation for Pakistan qualification to Semi-final. If they restrict Bangladesh for 100-150 (RR:2-3) and chase the target in 10-15 overs (RR:10), wont their run rate better than New Zealand. Then why is everyone saying that Pakistan will be eliminated if Bangladesh bats first." -- It's what happens over the course of nine games that matters, and not a one-off result that boosts NRR. Effectively, Pakistan will rue their shocker against West Indies.

4184___Dawlat Zadran to Gayle, no run, left alone as this is angled across.

4184___0

4184___3.3

4184___Dawlat Zadran to Gayle, FOUR runs, makes room and slaps this back past the bowler. Although I'm not sure that's where he wanted to hit it. Lined him up as he was going to go over mid-on. He'll take the runs nonetheless

4184___4

4184___Dawlat Zadran to Gayle, OUT, got him! Gayle has lost patience and his wicket in the process. Looked to back away to open up the off-side and swing big, but Dawlat saw him do that and fired this wider. Gayle looked to reach out to carve it away but ends up nicking it behind. Surely the last time we've seen Gayle at the 50-over World Cup.

4184___5.3

4184___Shai Hope at No. 3. Two slips and a gully

4184___Dawlat Zadran to Lewis, no run, huge appeal for caught behind. Did it come off the pad? Ikram is pretty confident but Afghanistan decide against it. Well, that's a scoring opportunity missed. Any amount of bat would've been enough to tickle it fine. Great take down the leg side though.

4184___Gulbadin Naib to Lewis, 2 runs, fuller, and he leans into a drive. A misfield by the man at sweeper cover -- oh, my it's Rashid Khan again -- allows them to come back for two

Firstly, Pakistan will have to win the toss and bat first (if they lost the toss and BD bat first, Pakistan's out).Moreover, then Pakistan will have to make exactly 350 and then beat BD by 312 runs;which means, you'll have to bowl them out under 38 runs. Simultaneously, Pakistan is out of the WC; and remember, that WI loss cost them the WC" --- Also, Bangladesh are a quality side, I think.

But we have to remember that , India lost their way in batting in recent matches mainly when Virat tried to attack. If Virat plays his natural game and asks people around him to attack, no one can stop India from lifting the trophy. " --- In all honesty, any of the four semifinalists can win this. But the two teams that seem to have some rhythm, and appear to know their best XI for the conditions are probably Australia and England. India come a close third

Wonder why the umpire didn't give it out initially. Oh dear, oh dear. Guess what? Impact comes back as umpire's call and I promise you this was not more than one millimeter outside off on impact. How lucky is he to survive? Mujeeb can't believe his luck. Ball tracking says this would've smashed middle and leg.

4184___33.5

4184___Rashid Khan to Hetmyer, 2 runs, CATCH MISSED! Hetmyer loses patience and goes for a slog sweep. The top edge takes it miles up in the air, and the only player who was close enough to it was Shinwari at midwicket, but he was running back. Couldn't position himself close enough to that, and in the end, I doubt he got enough on it. Rashid comes close a couple of times to nabbing Hetmyer, but just can't!

4184___Sayed Shirzad to Pooran, 1 run, drilled to mid-off, where Gulbadin dives an gets a hand on it, but can't quite latch on. Tough catch missed . Kept getting away from the captain

4184___1

4184___Sayed Shirzad to Holder, 1 run, length ball on middle, eased past the bowler

4184___1

4184___40.2

4184___Sayed Shirzad to Pooran, FOUR runs, rolls his wrists nicely to pull this into the gap at deep square. Too short, too slow and too easy

4184___4

4184___Sayed Shirzad to Pooran, no run, off the pad, rolls to the keeper.

4184___0

4184___40.4

4184___Sayed Shirzad to Pooran, 1 run, pulled all along the ground to deep midwicket

4184___1

4184___40.5

4184___Sayed Shirzad to Holder, 2 runs, slower delivery on the pads, would you believe it if I say he only nudged it a little past short midwicket, but strolls back for the second. Sure, the fielder had to run in from the ropes, but the bowler could've done a lot better there. Eventually by the time he took off, the second was on. He was also limited by the fact that there was no one backing up. Very poor from Afghanistan

4184___41.2

4184___Rashid Khan to Pooran, 1 run, this time he gets a thick edge, no slip, so it rolls to short third man. Again looking to cut but this one skid through and kept drifting away. Can't call that a chance for the keeper, even though it deflected off his gloves

4184___1

4184___41.5

4184___Rashid Khan to Holder, no run, off the pad, lobs high but the keeper can't get there. Thought they'd belt out an appeal but it appears to have taken an inside-edge. Very close, plumb even if that wasn't the case.

4184___1

4184___44.1

4184___Mujeeb Ur Rahman to Holder, SIX runs, brilliant, simply brilliant. Just lands in front of those hospitality boxes at cow corner. Cleared his front leg and swung this length ball across the line to clear the ropes quite effortlessly

4184___6

4184___44.2

4184___Mujeeb Ur Rahman to Holder, 1 run, full toss which he flicks one bounce to Rashid at deep midwicket

4184___1

4184___Some football news to salivate you even more. Heard of the 'New Ronaldo'? For whom a transfer fee of 126 million euros was made. Atletico Madrid won the race for Benfica forward Joao Felix yesterday, making him the fifth most expensive footballer ever. Oh, and by the way, the Portugal star is only 19.

4184___46.4

4184___Dawlat Zadran to Holder, SIX runs, don't bother looking for that! Those at the far end may have sprained necks if Holder continues to hit like this. Slower ball, makes room, clears his front leg and swings to clear deep midwicket again. Massive hit

4184___6

4184___46.5

4184___Dawlat Zadran to Holder, 2 runs, eased back to the bowler, who lazily puts his boot out to stop but can't and they get a second even though the ball went no more than a few yards from the turf towards mid-on.

4184___3

4184___47.4

4184___Mujeeb Ur Rahman to Holder, FOUR runs, squeezes one and this races off a thick edge past short third man. Angled his bat, sure but did that go where he intended? Me thinks not.

4184___Dawlat Zadran to Holder, SIX runs, makes room and belts this low full toss over wide long-on. Went for the yorker, misses his length and then saw this sail over. The Big Jase is having fun. Clean striking right out of the top drawer. He's a superb batsman to watch

4184___6

4184___48.1

4184___N Pooran run out (Ikram Alikhil(wk)/Sayed Shirzad) 58 (66m 43b 6x4 1x6) SR: 134.88

4184___Sayed Shirzad to Holder, OUT, swings, misses, rolls to the keeper. The non-striker takes off for a bye, the captain stays his ground, and it's a run-out at the bowler's end. Pooran ran the entire length of the pitch and turned back. Now, he can continue heading back to the change room.

4184___4

4184___49.5

4184___Sayed Shirzad to Brathwaite, FOUR runs, straight through the captain's hands at long-off. Bounces into the ropes. What should've been a wicket is now a boundary. He used the depth of the crease to get under the length and wallop this straight. The sun may have got in Gulbadin's way.

4184___49.6

4184___##########

4184___West Indies go into a huddle. Jason Holder has some words of encouragement to fire his team up, and the Afghanistan openers walk out to start this chase. Rahmat Shah will be at the non-striker's end, while captain Gulbadin Naib will take first strike

4184___Sheldon Cottrell has the new ball for West Indies. Just one slip

4184___Two slips for Roach

4184___Roach to Gulbadin Naib, FOUR runs, shorter again, and this time he slogs it away behind square on the leg side. Waits for it, and connects well, rocking back to transfer his weight as he hits that

Ran in, settled underneath but somehow looked jittery as the ball descended. Massive slice of luck for Rahmat, who would've been cursing himself for playing that rash stroke.

Does he have the ball in his gloves, though? The ball seems to have moved out of his gloves when he breaks the stumps. That will be not out.

4184___Brathwaite to Najibullah Zadran, SIX runs, full ball, and he has slapped this high, wide and handsome. Straight as a die! These batsmen seem to be getting used to Brathwaite's pace

So what's the point, really? Do better ESPN." --- Knock yourself out with whomever you want to praise. I think most of it today could belong to Afghanistan

4184___Cottrell to Najibullah Zadran, 1 run, short, sharp from Cottrell, and he plays the no-look pull, just taking his bottom hand off. It skews off into the gap between short fine leg and deep square leg

4184___Ikram Alikhil lbw b Gayle 86 (142m 93b 8x4 0x6) SR: 92.47

4184___Gayle to Ikram Alikhil, OUT, looks for the sweep, and given out leg before. He has chosen to review this! It was full, but could have been darting down the leg side, unless it stays with umpire's call. There seems to be no inside edge. Perhaps a touch too full to have employed the sweep. It's three-reds, and that's the end of Ikram Alikhil! He's played his hand in bringing Afghanistan close, but this was a bad time to have gotten out, and to the part-timer. But what a moment for Chris Gayle, in what should be his last World Cup innings. A smart catch, and now getting a teenager on the verge of a famous century!

4184___Gayle to Asghar Afghan, 1 run, OUT, looks like this is out! Asghar flicks this towards square leg. They look for two, but Gayle goes sprinting after that. That causes enough confusion to just slow up the two batsmen as they cross, and Najib is run out at the non-striker's by a sharp, flat throw from midwicket!

Then an aborted delivery because a fielder was sprinting to get into the ring to stop the no ball. Followed by a run out of Afghan's best batsman. It's not been the msot quality game this."

4184___Maz Mohammad: "Afghanistan started the tournament as if the only way they know to play is the T20 way. As the tournament progressed they have showed that they can learn and apply themselves to last the full 50 overs. They need to play more with the top teams so they can become consistent and improve on it."

4184___Holder turns to Brathwaite. Surely, Afghanistan have to go big against him

4184___Brathwaite to Asghar Afghan, no run, full, wide, and just within the tramlines, as Afghan looks to give it some...and misses

4184___Asghar Afghan c Holder b Brathwaite 40 (47m 32b 4x4 1x6) SR: 125.00

4184___Brathwaite to Asghar Afghan, OUT, good catch at long off by Holder! Thrown wide and full again, and Afghan shimmies across to get to that - it would have been a wide if he had missed - and he looked to go inside out. Toe-ends it down towards long off, and West Indies do well to keep big Jason Holder there for this steepling catch. Perfectly balanced, even though he lost his shades

4184___Brathwaite to Rashid Khan, SIX runs, he has cleared long-off! Slower ball, Rashid backed away and held his shape before giving it the thump it needed. He was hitting it towards the long boundary but the timing was top notch. Not even Holder stood a chance
